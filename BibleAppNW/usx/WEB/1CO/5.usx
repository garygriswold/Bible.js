    <verse number="1" style="v" />It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father’s wife. <verse number="2" style="v" />You are puffed up, and didn’t rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you. <verse number="3" style="v" />For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing. <verse number="4" style="v" />In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, <verse number="5" style="v" />are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</para>

    <verse number="6" style="v" />Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump? <verse number="7" style="v" />Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place. <verse number="8" style="v" />Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. <verse number="9" style="v" />I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners; <verse number="10" style="v" />yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortionists, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world. <verse number="11" style="v" />But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortionist. Don’t even eat with such a person. <verse number="12" style="v" />For what do I have to do with also judging those who are outside? Don’t you judge those who are within? <verse number="13" style="v" />But those who are outside, God judges. “Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.”<note caller="+" style="x"></note></para>
