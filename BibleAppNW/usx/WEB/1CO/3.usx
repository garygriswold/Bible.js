    <verse number="1" style="v" />Brothers, I couldn’t speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ. <verse number="2" style="v" />I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren’t yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready, <verse number="3" style="v" />for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren’t you fleshly, and don’t you walk in the ways of men? <verse number="4" style="v" />For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you fleshly? <verse number="5" style="v" />Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him? <verse number="6" style="v" />I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase. <verse number="7" style="v" />So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase. <verse number="8" style="v" />Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor. <verse number="9" style="v" />For we are God’s fellow workers. You are God’s farming, God’s building. <verse number="10" style="v" />According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it. <verse number="11" style="v" />For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ. <verse number="12" style="v" />But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble; <verse number="13" style="v" />each man’s work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man’s work is. <verse number="14" style="v" />If any man’s work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward. <verse number="15" style="v" />If any man’s work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="16" style="v" />Don’t you know that you are a temple of God, and that God’s Spirit lives in you? <verse number="17" style="v" />If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, which you are.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" />Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise. <verse number="19" style="v" />For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, “He has taken the wise in their craftiness.”<note caller="+ Job 5:13" style="x"></note> <verse number="20" style="v" />And again, “The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.”<note caller="+ Psalm 94:11" style="x"></note> <verse number="21" style="v" />Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours, <verse number="22" style="v" />whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours, <verse number="23" style="v" />and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.</para>
