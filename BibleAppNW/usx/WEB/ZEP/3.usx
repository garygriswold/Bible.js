    <verse number="1" style="v" />Woe to her who is rebellious and polluted, the oppressing city! <verse number="2" style="v" />She didn’t obey the voice. She didn’t receive correction. She didn’t trust in Yahweh. She didn’t draw near to her God. <verse number="3" style="v" />Her princes within her are roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves. They leave nothing until the next day. <verse number="4" style="v" />Her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people. Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the law. <verse number="5" style="v" />Yahweh, within her, is righteous. He will do no wrong. Every morning he brings his justice to light. He doesn’t fail, but the unjust know no shame. <verse number="6" style="v" />I have cut off nations. Their battlements are desolate. I have made their streets waste, so that no one passes by. Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant. <verse number="7" style="v" />I said, “Just fear me. Receive correction, so that her dwelling won’t be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her.” But they rose early and corrupted all their doings. <verse number="8" style="v" />“Therefore wait for me”, says Yahweh, “until the day that I rise up to the prey, for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour on them my indignation, even all my fierce anger, for all the earth will be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. <verse number="9" style="v" />For then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that they may all call on Yahweh’s name, to serve him shoulder to shoulder. <verse number="10" style="v" />From beyond the rivers of Cush, my worshipers, even the daughter of my dispersed people, will bring my offering. <verse number="11" style="v" />In that day you will not be disappointed for all your doings, in which you have transgressed against me; for then I will take away out from among you your proudly exulting ones, and you will no more be haughty in my holy mountain. <verse number="12" style="v" />But I will leave among you an afflicted and poor people, and they will take refuge in Yahweh’s name. <verse number="13" style="v" />The remnant of Israel will not do iniquity, nor speak lies, neither will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth, for they will feed and lie down, and no one will make them afraid.”</para>

    <verse number="14" style="v" />Sing, daughter of Zion! Shout, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem. <verse number="15" style="v" />Yahweh has taken away your judgments. He has thrown out your enemy. The King of Israel, Yahweh, is among you. You will not be afraid of evil any more. <verse number="16" style="v" />In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, “Don’t be afraid, Zion. Don’t let your hands be weak.” <verse number="17" style="v" />Yahweh, your God, is among you, a mighty one who will save. He will rejoice over you with joy. He will calm you in his love. He will rejoice over you with singing. <verse number="18" style="v" />I will remove those who grieve about the appointed feasts from you. They are a burden and a reproach to you. <verse number="19" style="v" />Behold,<note style="f" caller="+ “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection."></note> at that time I will deal with all those who afflict you, and I will save those who are lame, and gather those who were driven away. I will give them praise and honor, whose shame has been in all the earth. <verse number="20" style="v" />At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you; for I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says Yahweh.</para>
