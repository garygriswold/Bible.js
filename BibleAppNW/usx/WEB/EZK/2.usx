    <verse number="3" style="v" />He said to me, “Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day. <verse number="4" style="v" />The children are impudent and stiff-hearted. I am sending you to them, and you shall tell them, ‘Thus says the Lord<note style="f" caller="+ The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”"></note> Yahweh.’ <verse number="5" style="v" />They, whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse, for they are a rebellious house, yet they will know that there has been a prophet among them. <verse number="6" style="v" />You, son of man, don’t be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you, and you do dwell among scorpions. Don’t be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house. <verse number="7" style="v" />You shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse; for they are most rebellious. <verse number="8" style="v" />But you, son of man, hear what I tell you. Don’t be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth, and eat that which I give you.”</para>
