    <verse number="1" style="v" />Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, <verse number="2" style="v" />to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men. <verse number="3" style="v" />For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. <verse number="4" style="v" />But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared, <verse number="5" style="v" />not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, <verse number="6" style="v" />whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior; <verse number="7" style="v" />that being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. <verse number="8" style="v" />This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men; <verse number="9" style="v" />but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. <verse number="10" style="v" />Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning, <verse number="11" style="v" />knowing that such a one is perverted and sins, being self-condemned.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there. <verse number="13" style="v" />Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them. <verse number="14" style="v" />Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</para>
