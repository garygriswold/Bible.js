    <verse number="1" style="v" />Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <verse number="2" style="v" />“Behold, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: <verse number="3" style="v" />and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all kinds of workmanship, <verse number="4" style="v" />to devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, <verse number="5" style="v" />and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of workmanship. <verse number="6" style="v" />Behold, I myself have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you: <verse number="7" style="v" />the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the testimony, the mercy seat that is on it, all the furniture of the Tent, <verse number="8" style="v" />the table and its vessels, the pure lamp stand with all its vessels, the altar of incense, <verse number="9" style="v" />the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, the basin and its base, <verse number="10" style="v" />the finely worked garments—the holy garments for Aaron the priest—the garments of his sons to minister in the priest’s office, <verse number="11" style="v" />the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded you they shall do.”</para>

    <verse number="12" style="v" />Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <verse number="13" style="v" />“Speak also to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Most certainly you shall keep my Sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies you. <verse number="14" style="v" />You shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. <verse number="15" style="v" />Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Yahweh. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death. <verse number="16" style="v" />Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. <verse number="17" style="v" />It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.’”</para>
