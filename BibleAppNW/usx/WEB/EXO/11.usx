When he lets you go, he will surely thrust you out altogether. <verse number="2" style="v" />Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man ask of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.” <verse number="3" style="v" />Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians.
