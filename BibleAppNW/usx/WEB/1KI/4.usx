    <verse number="20" style="v" />Judah and Israel were numerous as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry. <verse number="21" style="v" />Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. They brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life. <verse number="22" style="v" />Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty cors<note style="f" caller="+"></note> of fine flour, sixty measures of meal, <verse number="23" style="v" />ten head of fat cattle, twenty head of cattle out of the pastures, and one hundred sheep, besides deer, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fattened fowl. <verse number="24" style="v" />For he had dominion over all on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River: and he had peace on all sides around him. <verse number="25" style="v" />Judah and Israel lived safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon. <verse number="26" style="v" />Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. <verse number="27" style="v" />Those officers provided food for king Solomon, and for all who came to king Solomon’s table, every man in his month. They let nothing be lacking. <verse number="28" style="v" />They also brought Barley and straw for the horses and swift steeds to the place where the officers were, each man according to his duty. <verse number="29" style="v" />God gave Solomon abundant wisdom and understanding, and very great understanding, even as the sand that is on the seashore. <verse number="30" style="v" />Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt. <verse number="31" style="v" />For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations all around. <verse number="32" style="v" />He spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs numbered one thousand five. <verse number="33" style="v" />He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that grows out of the wall; he also spoke of animals, of birds, of creeping things, and of fish. <verse number="34" style="v" />People of all nations came to hear the wisdom of Solomon, sent by all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.</para>
