    <verse number="1" style="v" />Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed among you as crucified? <verse number="2" style="v" />I just want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith? <verse number="3" style="v" />Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh? <verse number="4" style="v" />Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain? <verse number="5" style="v" />He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you, and does miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith? <verse number="6" style="v" />Even as Abraham “believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.” <verse number="7" style="v" />Know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are children of Abraham. <verse number="8" style="v" />The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you all the nations will be blessed.”<note caller="+" style="x"></note> <verse number="9" style="v" />So then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham. <verse number="10" style="v" />For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who doesn’t continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.”<note caller="+" style="x"></note> <verse number="11" style="v" />Now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident, for, “The righteous will live by faith.”<note caller="+" style="x"></note> <verse number="12" style="v" />The law is not of faith, but, “The man who does them will live by them.”<note caller="+" style="x"></note></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,”<note caller="+" style="x"></note> <verse number="14" style="v" />that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. <verse number="15" style="v" />Brothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man’s covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void, or adds to it. <verse number="16" style="v" />Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring.<note style="f" caller="+"></note> He doesn’t say, “To descendants<note style="f" caller="+"></note>”, as of many, but as of one, “To your offspring<note style="f" caller="+"></note>”,<note caller="+" style="x"></note> which is Christ. <verse number="17" style="v" />Now I say this: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect. <verse number="18" style="v" />For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.</para>

    <verse number="19" style="v" />Then why is there the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring<note style="f" caller="+"></note> should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator. <verse number="20" style="v" />Now a mediator is not between one, but God is one. <verse number="21" style="v" />Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law. <verse number="22" style="v" />But the Scriptures imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. <verse number="23" style="v" />But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined for the faith which should afterwards be revealed. <verse number="24" style="v" />So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. <verse number="25" style="v" />But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor. <verse number="26" style="v" />For you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus. <verse number="27" style="v" />For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. <verse number="28" style="v" />There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. <verse number="29" style="v" />If you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s offspring<note style="f" caller="+"></note> and heirs according to promise.</para>
