    <verse number="1" style="v" />Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren’t tempted. <verse number="2" style="v" />Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. <verse number="3" style="v" />For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. <verse number="4" style="v" />But let each man examine his own work, and then he will have reason to boast in himself, and not in someone else. <verse number="5" style="v" />For each man will bear his own burden. <verse number="6" style="v" />But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches. <verse number="7" style="v" />Don’t be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. <verse number="8" style="v" />For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. <verse number="9" style="v" />Let us not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we don’t give up. <verse number="10" style="v" />So then, as we have opportunity, let’s do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.</para>

    <verse number="11" style="v" />See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand. <verse number="12" style="v" />As many as desire to make a good impression in the flesh compel you to be circumcised; just so they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. <verse number="13" style="v" />For even they who receive circumcision don’t keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh. <verse number="14" style="v" />But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. <verse number="15" style="v" />For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. <verse number="16" style="v" />As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God’s Israel. <verse number="17" style="v" />From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" />The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.</para>
