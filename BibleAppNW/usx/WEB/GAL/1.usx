    <verse number="1" style="v" />Paul, an apostle (not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead), <verse number="2" style="v" />and all the brothers<note style="f" caller="+ The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”"></note> who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia: <verse number="3" style="v" />Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, <verse number="4" style="v" />who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father— <verse number="5" style="v" />to whom be the glory forever and ever.

    <verse number="6" style="v" />I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different “good news”; <verse number="7" style="v" />and there isn’t another “good news.” Only there are some who trouble you, and want to pervert the Good News of Christ. <verse number="8" style="v" />But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed. <verse number="9" style="v" />As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any “good news” other than that which you received, let him be cursed. <verse number="10" style="v" />For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn’t be a servant of Christ. <verse number="11" style="v" />But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man. <verse number="12" style="v" />For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ. <verse number="13" style="v" />For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it. <verse number="14" style="v" />I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers. <verse number="15" style="v" />But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace, <verse number="16" style="v" />to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn’t immediately confer with flesh and blood, <verse number="17" style="v" />nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus. <verse number="18" style="v" />Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days. <verse number="19" style="v" />But of the other apostles I saw no one, except James, the Lord’s brother. <verse number="20" style="v" />Now about the things which I write to you, behold,<note style="f" caller="+ “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection."></note> before God, I’m not lying. <verse number="21" style="v" />Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. <verse number="22" style="v" />I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ, <verse number="23" style="v" />but they only heard: “He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.” <verse number="24" style="v" />And they glorified God in me.</para>
