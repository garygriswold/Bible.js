    <verse number="1" style="v" />See how great a love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God! For this cause the world doesn’t know us, because it didn’t know him. <verse number="2" style="v" />Beloved, now we are children of God, and it is not yet revealed what we will be. But we know that, when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is. <verse number="3" style="v" />Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure. <verse number="4" style="v" />Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness. <verse number="5" style="v" />You know that he was revealed to take away our sins, and in him is no sin. <verse number="6" style="v" />Whoever remains in him doesn’t sin. Whoever sins hasn’t seen him and doesn’t know him.</para>

    <verse number="7" style="v" />Little children, let no one lead you astray. He who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. <verse number="8" style="v" />He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To this end the Son of God was revealed: that he might destroy the works of the devil. <verse number="9" style="v" />Whoever is born of God doesn’t commit sin, because his seed remains in him; and he can’t sin, because he is born of God. <verse number="10" style="v" />In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil. Whoever doesn’t do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who doesn’t love his brother. <verse number="11" style="v" />For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another; <verse number="12" style="v" />unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brother’s righteous. <verse number="13" style="v" />Don’t be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you. <verse number="14" style="v" />We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. He who doesn’t love his brother remains in death. <verse number="15" style="v" />Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him.</para>

    <verse number="16" style="v" />By this we know love, because he laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. <verse number="17" style="v" />But whoever has the world’s goods, and sees his brother in need, and closes his heart of compassion against him, how does God’s love remain in him? <verse number="18" style="v" />My little children, let’s not love in word only, or with the tongue only, but in deed and truth. <verse number="19" style="v" />And by this we know that we are of the truth, and persuade our hearts before him, <verse number="20" style="v" />because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things. <verse number="21" style="v" />Beloved, if our hearts don’t condemn us, we have boldness toward God; <verse number="22" style="v" />and whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight. <verse number="23" style="v" />This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he commanded. <verse number="24" style="v" />He who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him. By this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.</para>
