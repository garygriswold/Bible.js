    <verse number="1" style="v" />Therefore you shall love Yahweh your God, and keep his instructions, his statutes, his ordinances, and his commandments, always. <verse number="2" style="v" />Know this day: for I don’t speak with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of Yahweh your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm, <verse number="3" style="v" />his signs, and his works, which he did in the middle of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land; <verse number="4" style="v" />and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued you, and how Yahweh has destroyed them to this day; <verse number="5" style="v" />and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place; <verse number="6" style="v" />and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the middle of all Israel; <verse number="7" style="v" />but your eyes have seen all of Yahweh’s great work which he did. <verse number="8" style="v" />Therefore you shall keep all the commandment which I command you today, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land, where you go over to possess it; <verse number="9" style="v" />and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give to them and to their offspring,<note style="f" caller="+"></note> a land flowing with milk and honey. <verse number="10" style="v" />For the land, where you go in to possess it, isn’t as the land of Egypt, that you came out of, where you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs; <verse number="11" style="v" />but the land, where you go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water from the rain of the sky, <verse number="12" style="v" />a land which Yahweh your God cares for. Yahweh your God’s eyes are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year. <verse number="13" style="v" />It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you today, to love Yahweh your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, <verse number="14" style="v" />that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your oil. <verse number="15" style="v" />I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full. <verse number="16" style="v" />Be careful, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; <verse number="17" style="v" />and Yahweh’s anger be kindled against you, and he shut up the sky, so that there is no rain, and the land doesn’t yield its fruit; and you perish quickly from off the good land which Yahweh gives you. <verse number="18" style="v" />Therefore you shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul. You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes. <verse number="19" style="v" />You shall teach them to your children, talking of them, when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up. <verse number="20" style="v" />You shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates; <verse number="21" style="v" />that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth. <verse number="22" style="v" />For if you shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cling to him; <verse number="23" style="v" />then will Yahweh drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves. <verse number="24" style="v" />Every place whereon the sole of your foot treads shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the western sea shall be your border. <verse number="25" style="v" />No man will be able to stand before you. Yahweh your God will lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you tread on, as he has spoken to you. <verse number="26" style="v" />Behold, I set before you today a blessing and a curse: <verse number="27" style="v" />the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, which I command you today; <verse number="28" style="v" />and the curse, if you do not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you today, to go after other gods, which you have not known. <verse number="29" style="v" />It shall happen, when Yahweh your God brings you into the land where you go to possess it, that you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal. <verse number="30" style="v" />Aren’t they beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah, near Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh? <verse number="31" style="v" />For you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your God gives you, and you shall possess it, and dwell therein. <verse number="32" style="v" />You shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you today.</para>
