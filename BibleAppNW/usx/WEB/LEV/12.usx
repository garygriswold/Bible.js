    <verse number="1" style="v" />Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <verse number="2" style="v" />“Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘If a woman conceives, and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of her monthly period she shall be unclean. <verse number="3" style="v" />In the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. <verse number="4" style="v" />She shall continue in the blood of purification thirty-three days. She shall not touch any holy thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are completed. <verse number="5" style="v" />But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her period; and she shall continue in the blood of purification sixty-six days.</para>

    <verse number="6" style="v" />“‘When the days of her purification are completed, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the door of the Tent of Meeting, a year old lamb for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering: <verse number="7" style="v" />and he shall offer it before Yahweh, and make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood.</para>
