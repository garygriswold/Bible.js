    <verse number="1" style="v" />Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. <verse number="2" style="v" />He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, according to all that his father Uzziah had done. However he didn’t enter into Yahweh’s temple. The people still acted corruptly. <verse number="3" style="v" />He built the upper gate of Yahweh’s house, and he built much on the wall of Ophel. <verse number="4" style="v" />Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers. <verse number="5" style="v" />He also fought with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. The children of Ammon gave him the same year one hundred talents<note style="f" caller="+ A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds"></note> of silver, ten thousand cors<note style="f" caller="+ 1 cor is the same as a homer, or about 55.9 U.
