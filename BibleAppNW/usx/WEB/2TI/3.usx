    <verse number="1" style="v" />But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come. <verse number="2" style="v" />For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, <verse number="3" style="v" />without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, not lovers of good, <verse number="4" style="v" />traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; <verse number="5" style="v" />holding a form of godliness, but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also. <verse number="6" style="v" />For some of these are people who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, <verse number="7" style="v" />always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. <verse number="8" style="v" />Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith are rejected. <verse number="9" style="v" />But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be. <verse number="10" style="v" />But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness, <verse number="11" style="v" />persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all. <verse number="12" style="v" />Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. <verse number="13" style="v" />But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. <verse number="14" style="v" />But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them. <verse number="15" style="v" />From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus. <verse number="16" style="v" />Every Scripture is God-breathed and<note style="f" caller="+"></note> profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, <verse number="17" style="v" />that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.</para>
