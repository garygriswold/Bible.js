    <verse number="2" style="v" />In that day, Yahweh’s branch will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the beauty and glory of the survivors of Israel. <verse number="3" style="v" />It will happen, that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem; <verse number="4" style="v" />when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from within it, by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning. <verse number="5" style="v" />Yahweh will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory will be a canopy. <verse number="6" style="v" />There will be a pavilion for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge and for a shelter from storm and from rain.</para>
