    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the Hellenists<note style="f" caller="+"></note> against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service. <verse number="2" style="v" />The twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, “It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables. <verse number="3" style="v" />Therefore select from among you, brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. <verse number="4" style="v" />But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.”</para>

    <verse number="5" style="v" />These words pleased the whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch; <verse number="6" style="v" />whom they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them. <verse number="7" style="v" />The word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly. A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</para>

    <verse number="8" style="v" />Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people. <verse number="9" style="v" />But some of those who were of the synagogue called “The Libertines”, and of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephen. <verse number="10" style="v" />They weren’t able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke. <verse number="11" style="v" />Then they secretly induced men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.” <verse number="12" style="v" />They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against him and seized him, and brought him in to the council, <verse number="13" style="v" />and set up false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law. <verse number="14" style="v" />For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.” <verse number="15" style="v" />All who sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel.</para>
