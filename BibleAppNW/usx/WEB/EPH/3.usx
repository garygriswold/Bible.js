    <verse number="1" style="v" />For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles, <verse number="2" style="v" />if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you; <verse number="3" style="v" />how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words, <verse number="4" style="v" />by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ; <verse number="5" style="v" />which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; <verse number="6" style="v" />that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News, <verse number="7" style="v" />of which I was made a servant, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power. <verse number="8" style="v" />To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, <verse number="9" style="v" />and to make all men see what is the administration<note style="f" caller="+"></note> of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ; <verse number="10" style="v" />to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places, <verse number="11" style="v" />according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord; <verse number="12" style="v" />in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him. <verse number="13" style="v" />Therefore I ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory.</para>

    <verse number="14" style="v" />For this cause, I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, <verse number="15" style="v" />from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, <verse number="16" style="v" />that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man; <verse number="17" style="v" />that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love, <verse number="18" style="v" />may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and height and depth, <verse number="19" style="v" />and to know Christ’s love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. <verse number="20" style="v" />Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us, <verse number="21" style="v" />to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.</para>
