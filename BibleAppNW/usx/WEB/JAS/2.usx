    <verse number="1" style="v" />My brothers, don’t hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with partiality. <verse number="2" style="v" />For if a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, comes into your synagogue,<note style="f" caller="+"></note> and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in; <verse number="3" style="v" />and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing, and say, “Sit here in a good place”; and you tell the poor man, “Stand there,” or “Sit by my footstool”; <verse number="4" style="v" />haven’t you shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts? <verse number="5" style="v" />Listen, my beloved brothers. Didn’t God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him? <verse number="6" style="v" />But you have dishonored the poor man. Don’t the rich oppress you, and personally drag you before the courts? <verse number="7" style="v" />Don’t they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called? <verse number="8" style="v" />However, if you fulfill the royal law, according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,”<note caller="+" style="x"></note> you do well. <verse number="9" style="v" />But if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors. <verse number="10" style="v" />For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all. <verse number="11" style="v" />For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,”<note caller="+" style="x"></note> also said, “Do not commit murder.”<note caller="+" style="x"></note> Now if you do not commit adultery, but murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. <verse number="12" style="v" />So speak, and so do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom. <verse number="13" style="v" />For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</para>

    <verse number="14" style="v" />What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works? Can faith save him? <verse number="15" style="v" />And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food, <verse number="16" style="v" />and one of you tells them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled”; and yet you didn’t give them the things the body needs, what good is it? <verse number="17" style="v" />Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself. <verse number="18" style="v" />Yes, a man will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without works, and I by my works will show you my faith.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe, and shudder. <verse number="20" style="v" />But do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead? <verse number="21" style="v" />Wasn’t Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? <verse number="22" style="v" />You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected; <verse number="23" style="v" />and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness”;<note caller="+" style="x"></note> and he was called the friend of God. <verse number="24" style="v" />You see then that by works, a man is justified, and not only by faith. <verse number="25" style="v" />In the same way, wasn’t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way? <verse number="26" style="v" />For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.</para>
