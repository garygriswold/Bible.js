    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now these are those who came to David to Ziklag, while he was a fugitive from Saul the son of Kish. They were among the mighty men, his helpers in war. <verse number="2" style="v" />They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow. They were of Saul’s relatives of the tribe of Benjamin. <verse number="3" style="v" />The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah; Jehu the Anathothite; <verse number="4" style="v" />Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty and a leader of the thirty; Jeremiah; Jahaziel; Johanan; Jozabad the Gederathite; <verse number="5" style="v" />Eluzai; Jerimoth; Bealiah; Shemariah; Shephatiah the Haruphite; <verse number="6" style="v" />Elkanah, Isshiah Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites; <verse number="7" style="v" />and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor. <verse number="8" style="v" />Some Gadites joined David in the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, men trained for war, who could handle shield and spear; whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the gazelles on the mountains: <verse number="9" style="v" />Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, <verse number="10" style="v" />Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, <verse number="11" style="v" />Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, <verse number="12" style="v" />Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, <verse number="13" style="v" />Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbannai the eleventh. <verse number="14" style="v" />These of the sons of Gad were captains of the army: he who was least was equal to one hundred, and the greatest to one thousand. <verse number="15" style="v" />These are those who went over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all who lived in the valleys, both toward the east and toward the west. <verse number="16" style="v" />Some of the children of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David. <verse number="17" style="v" />David went out to meet them, and answered them, “If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart will be united with you; but if you have come to betray me to my adversaries, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers see this and rebuke it.” <verse number="18" style="v" />Then the Spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, and he said, “We are yours, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse. Peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you.” Then David received them, and made them captains of the band. <verse number="19" style="v" />Some of Manasseh also joined David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle; but they didn’t help them; for the lords of the Philistines sent him away after consultation, saying, “He will desert to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.”</para>

    <verse number="20" style="v" />As he went to Ziklag, some from Manasseh joined him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands who were of Manasseh. <verse number="21" style="v" />They helped David against the band of rovers; for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the army. <verse number="22" style="v" />For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great army, like God’s army.</para>
