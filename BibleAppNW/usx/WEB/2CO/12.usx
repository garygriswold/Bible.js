    <verse number="1" style="v" />It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. For I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. <verse number="2" style="v" />I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I don’t know, or whether out of the body, I don’t know; God knows), such a one caught up into the third heaven. <verse number="3" style="v" />I know such a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body, I don’t know; God knows), <verse number="4" style="v" />how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. <verse number="5" style="v" />On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses. <verse number="6" style="v" />For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me, or hears from me. <verse number="7" style="v" />By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively. <verse number="8" style="v" />Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me. <verse number="9" style="v" />He has said to me, <char style="wj">“My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”</char> Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong. <verse number="11" style="v" />I have become foolish in boasting. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for in nothing was I inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing. <verse number="12" style="v" />Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty works. <verse number="13" style="v" />For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your possessions, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children. <verse number="15" style="v" />I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less? <verse number="16" style="v" />But be it so, I did not myself burden you. But, being crafty, I caught you with deception. <verse number="17" style="v" />Did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you? <verse number="18" style="v" />I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn’t we walk in the same spirit? Didn’t we walk in the same steps? <verse number="19" style="v" />Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying. <verse number="20" style="v" />For I am afraid that by any means, when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you as you don’t desire; that by any means there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, riots; <verse number="21" style="v" />that again when I come my God would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustfulness which they committed.</para>
