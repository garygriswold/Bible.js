    <verse number="1" style="v" />But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow. <verse number="2" style="v" />For if I make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me? <verse number="3" style="v" />And I wrote this very thing to you, so that, when I came, I wouldn’t have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be shared by all of you. <verse number="4" style="v" />For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you. <verse number="5" style="v" />But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all. <verse number="6" style="v" />This punishment which was inflicted by the many is sufficient for such a one; <verse number="7" style="v" />so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow. <verse number="8" style="v" />Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him. <verse number="9" style="v" />For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things. <verse number="10" style="v" />Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ, <verse number="11" style="v" />that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.</para>

    <verse number="12" style="v" />Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord, <verse number="13" style="v" />I had no relief for my spirit, because I didn’t find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went out into Macedonia. <verse number="14" style="v" />Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place. <verse number="15" style="v" />For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish; <verse number="16" style="v" />to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things? <verse number="17" style="v" />For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.</para>
