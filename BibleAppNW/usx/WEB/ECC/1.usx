    <verse number="1" style="v" />The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="2" style="v" />“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher; “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.” <verse number="3" style="v" />What does man gain from all his labor in which he labors under the sun? <verse number="4" style="v" />One generation goes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains forever. <verse number="5" style="v" />The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises. <verse number="6" style="v" />The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses. <verse number="7" style="v" />All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again. <verse number="8" style="v" />All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. <verse number="9" style="v" />That which has been is that which shall be; and that which has been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. <verse number="10" style="v" />Is there a thing of which it may be said, “Behold,<note style="f" caller="+"></note> this is new?” It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us. <verse number="11" style="v" />There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, among those that shall come after.</para>

    <verse number="12" style="v" />I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. <verse number="13" style="v" />I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God<note style="f" caller="+"></note> has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with. <verse number="14" style="v" />I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind. <verse number="15" style="v" />That which is crooked can’t be made straight; and that which is lacking can’t be counted. <verse number="16" style="v" />I said to myself, “Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.” <verse number="17" style="v" />I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind. <verse number="18" style="v" />For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</para>
