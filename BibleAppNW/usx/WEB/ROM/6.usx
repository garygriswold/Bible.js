    <verse number="1" style="v" />What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? <verse number="2" style="v" />May it never be! We who died to sin, how could we live in it any longer? <verse number="3" style="v" />Or don’t you know that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? <verse number="4" style="v" />We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life. <verse number="5" style="v" />For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will also be part of his resurrection; <verse number="6" style="v" />knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin. <verse number="7" style="v" />For he who has died has been freed from sin. <verse number="8" style="v" />But if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him; <verse number="9" style="v" />knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no more has dominion over him! <verse number="10" style="v" />For the death that he died, he died to sin one time; but the life that he lives, he lives to God. <verse number="11" style="v" />Thus consider yourselves also to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />Therefore don’t let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts. <verse number="13" style="v" />Also, do not present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God. <verse number="14" style="v" />For sin will not have dominion over you. For you are not under law, but under grace. <verse number="15" style="v" />What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? May it never be! <verse number="16" style="v" />Don’t you know that when you present yourselves as servants and obey someone, you are the servants of whomever you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness? <verse number="17" style="v" />But thanks be to God, that, whereas you were bondservants of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were delivered. <verse number="18" style="v" />Being made free from sin, you became bondservants of righteousness.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh, for as you presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to wickedness upon wickedness, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness for sanctification. <verse number="20" style="v" />For when you were servants of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. <verse number="21" style="v" />What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. <verse number="22" style="v" />But now, being made free from sin, and having become servants of God, you have your fruit of sanctification, and the result of eternal life. <verse number="23" style="v" />For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</para>
