    <p class="p">
    <span id="JHN:3:1" class="v">1&nbsp;</span>There was a man named Nicodemus, one of the Pharisees. He was an important Jewish leader. <span id="JHN:3:2" class="v">2&nbsp;</span>One night he came to Jesus and said, “Teacher, we know that you are a teacher sent from God. No one can do these miraculous signs that you do unless they have God’s help.”</p>
    <p class="p">
    <span id="JHN:3:3" class="v">3&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, “I assure you, everyone must be born again.<span id="JHN3-1" class="topf" caller="+" onclick="bibleShowNoteClick('JHN3-1');"> ☞ <span class="fr" closed="false" hidden="3:3 "></span><span class="fk" closed="false" style="display:none">born again </span><span class="ft" closed="false" style="display:none">In this verse and in verse 7 this phrase could be translated “born from above”.</span></span> Anyone who is not born again cannot be in God’s kingdom.”</p>
    <p class="p">
    <span id="JHN:3:4" class="v">4&nbsp;</span>Nicodemus said, “How can a man who is already old be born again? Can he go back into his mother’s womb and be born a second time?”</p>
    <p class="p">
    <span id="JHN:3:5" class="v">5&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, “Believe me when I say that everyone must be born from water and the Spirit. Anyone who is not born from water and the Spirit cannot enter God’s kingdom. <span id="JHN:3:6" class="v">6&nbsp;</span>The only life people get from their human parents is physical. But the new life that the Spirit gives a person is spiritual. <span id="JHN:3:7" class="v">7&nbsp;</span>Don’t be surprised that I told you, ‘You must be born again.’ <span id="JHN:3:8" class="v">8&nbsp;</span>The wind blows wherever it wants to. You hear it, but you don’t know where it is coming from or where it is going. It is the same with everyone who is born from the Spirit.”</p>
    <p class="p">
    <span id="JHN:3:9" class="v">9&nbsp;</span>Nicodemus asked, “How is all this possible?”</p>
    <p class="p">
    <span id="JHN:3:10" class="v">10&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, “You are an important teacher of Israel, and you still don’t understand these things? <span id="JHN:3:11" class="v">11&nbsp;</span>The truth is, we talk about what we know. We tell about what we have seen. But you people don’t accept what we tell you. <span id="JHN:3:12" class="v">12&nbsp;</span>I have told you about things here on earth, but you do not believe me. So I’m sure you will not believe me if I tell you about heavenly things! <span id="JHN:3:13" class="v">13&nbsp;</span>The only one who has ever gone up to God in heaven is the one who came down from heaven—the Son of Man. <span id="JHN:3:14" class="v">14&nbsp;</span>Remember the bronze snake that Moses lifted up in the desert?<span id="JHN3-2" class="topf" caller="+" onclick="bibleShowNoteClick('JHN3-2');"> ☞ <span class="fr" closed="false" hidden="3:14 "></span><span class="fk" closed="false" style="display:none">Moses lifted … desert </span><span class="ft" closed="false" style="display:none">When God’s people were dying from snake bites, God told Moses to put a brass snake on a pole for them to look at and be healed. See Num. 21:4-9.</span></span> Well, the Son of Man must be lifted up like that. <span id="JHN:3:15" class="v">15&nbsp;</span>Then everyone who believes in him can have eternal life.<span id="JHN3-3" class="topf" caller="+" onclick="bibleShowNoteClick('JHN3-3');"> ☞ <span class="fr" closed="false" hidden="3:15 "></span><span class="ft" closed="false" style="display:none">Some scholars think that Jesus’ words to Nicodemus end here.</span></span></p>
    <p class="p">
    <span id="JHN:3:16" class="v">16&nbsp;</span>“Yes, this is how God showed his great love for the world: he gave his only Son so that everyone who believes in him would not be lost but have eternal life. <span id="JHN:3:17" class="v">17&nbsp;</span>God sent his Son into the world. He did not send him to judge the world guilty, but to save the world through him. <span id="JHN:3:18" class="v">18&nbsp;</span>People who believe in God’s Son are not judged guilty. But people who do not believe are already judged, because they have not believed in God’s only Son. <span id="JHN:3:19" class="v">19&nbsp;</span>They are judged by this fact: the light<span id="JHN3-4" class="topf" caller="+" onclick="bibleShowNoteClick('JHN3-4');"> ☞ <span class="fr" closed="false" hidden="3:19 "></span><span class="fk" closed="false" style="display:none">light </span><span class="ft" closed="false" style="display:none">This means Jesus, the Word, who brought to the world understanding about God.</span></span> has come into the world. But they did not want light. They wanted darkness, because they were doing evil things. <span id="JHN:3:20" class="v">20&nbsp;</span>Everyone who does evil hates the light. They will not come to the light, because they do not want the light to show the bad things they have done. <span id="JHN:3:21" class="v">21&nbsp;</span>But anyone who follows the true way comes to the light. Then the light will show that God is at work in all they do.”</p>
    <p class="s">Jesus and John the Baptizer</p>
    <p class="p">
    <span id="JHN:3:22" class="v">22&nbsp;</span>After this, Jesus and his followers went into the area of Judea. There he stayed with his followers and baptized people. <span id="JHN:3:23" class="v">23&nbsp;</span>John was also baptizing people at Aenon, a place near Salim with plenty of water. People were going there to be baptized. <span id="JHN:3:24" class="v">24&nbsp;</span>This was before John was put in prison.</p>
    <p class="p">
    <span id="JHN:3:25" class="v">25&nbsp;</span>Some of John’s followers had an argument with another Jew about religious washing.<span id="JHN3-5" class="topf" caller="+" onclick="bibleShowNoteClick('JHN3-5');"> ☞ <span class="fr" closed="false" hidden="3:25 "></span><span class="fk" closed="false" style="display:none">religious washing </span><span class="ft" closed="false" style="display:none">The Jews had religious rules about washing in special ways before eating, before worshipping in the Temple and at other special times. So this reminded John’s followers of baptism (verse 26), another kind of religious washing.</span></span> <span id="JHN:3:26" class="v">26&nbsp;</span>Then they came to John and said, “Teacher, remember the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan River? He is the one you were telling everyone about. He is also baptizing people, and many are going to him.”</p>
    <p class="p">
    <span id="JHN:3:27" class="v">27&nbsp;</span>John answered, “A person can receive only what God gives. <span id="JHN:3:28" class="v">28&nbsp;</span>You yourselves heard me say, ‘I am not the Messiah. I am only the one God sent to prepare the way for him.’ <span id="JHN:3:29" class="v">29&nbsp;</span>I am like the friend of the bridegroom at a wedding. The bride is for the bridegroom, not for the friend. The friend just waits for instructions from the bridegroom. And he is happy to do whatever the bridegroom wants. That’s how I feel now. I could not be happier. <span id="JHN:3:30" class="v">30&nbsp;</span>He must become more and more important, and I must become less important.</p>
    <p class="s">The One Who Comes From Heaven</p>
    <p class="p">
    <span id="JHN:3:31" class="v">31&nbsp;</span>“The one who comes from above is greater than all others. The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth. He talks about things that are on the earth. But the one who comes from heaven is greater than all others. <span id="JHN:3:32" class="v">32&nbsp;</span>He tells what he has seen and heard, but people don’t accept what he says. <span id="JHN:3:33" class="v">33&nbsp;</span>Whoever accepts what he says has shown his agreement that God speaks the truth. <span id="JHN:3:34" class="v">34&nbsp;</span>The one sent by God always has words from God because God gives him the Spirit without limit. <span id="JHN:3:35" class="v">35&nbsp;</span>The Father loves the Son and has given him power over everything. <span id="JHN:3:36" class="v">36&nbsp;</span>Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life. But those who do not obey the Son will never have that life. They cannot escape God’s anger.”</p></section>
