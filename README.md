# Bible.js
The BibleApp is currently under development.

One key objective is to build an App that does not require localization for any language.  It does this by pulling some words from the text of the Bible to reuse in the user interface, but primarily the user interface is iconic instead of text.

The App is designed to be extremely easy to use, so that it would be usable by the very young, the very old, and people who only recently learned to read.  This objective is partly accomplished by limiting the features of the App to those that are essential.

This App will provide the ability for peer to peer installation using NFC, and for Apple, which will not permit this, there will be an ePub3 (ebook) version of the App.  This will be done so that it is possible for people to share the scriptures in locations of the world that filter and monitor the Internet, where governments are hostile to Christianity.

In order to provide Bible readers with an experience similar to the Ethiopian official in Acts 8, the App will provide a way for readers to ask questions that will be answered by a person.  This is an experimental feature that can be turned on or off for each language depending upon the availability of qualified volunteer instructors.
