The Bibles\nare currently stored on the server using OSX zip, which is PKZIP.  And the very nice\nJava classes for reading and writing Zip content are PKZIP.\n\n\t* gzip is slightly faster than pkzip and zlib claims to be faster.\n\tAlso, zlib gets better compression than gzip by a few bytes,\n\tand gzip is slightly better than pkzip.  But they all amount to\n\t0.201 compression when rounded.\n\n\ta zlib solution requires just a little C code.  The zlib site offers an excellent\n\tsample program zpipe.c  but zlib is not compatible with PK zip.\n\t \n\tThe mini zip solution is compatible with PKZIP, but I am having difficulty building \n\ta mixed language framework (c/swift)  There were many implementations on github.\n\tI chose the one that I did because it was written is swift, had a clean interface,\n\tand threw exceptions.\n\t\n\tAWS has a builtin gzip, but it works on data, not files. This is not appropriate \n\tfor the Bible files \n\nTime Measurements\n-----------------\n\nZIP PK\nzip real0m5.055s\nunzip real0m0.611s\n0.201 compression\n\ngzip\ngzip zip 0m4.979s\nreal unzip0m0.470s\n0.201 compression (smaller)\n\nzlib\n0.201 compression (smaller by a few bytes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t",
