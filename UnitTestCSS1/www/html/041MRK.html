<p class="mt2">The Good News According to</p>
<p class="mt">Mark</p>
<p id="1" class="c">1</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>As it is written in the prophets,</p>
<p class="q">“Behold,<span class="f">+</span> I send my messenger before your face,</p>
<p class="q2">who will prepare your way before you:<span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="q"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>the voice of one crying in the wilderness,</p>
<p class="q2">‘Make ready the way of the Lord!</p>
<p class="q2">Make his paths straight!’”<span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>John came baptizing<span class="f">+</span> in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>All the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>John was clothed with camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>He preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>I baptized you in<span class="f">+</span> water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>A voice came out of the sky, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of God’s Kingdom, <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>and saying, <span class="wj">“The time is fulfilled, and God’s Kingdom is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Immediately they left their nets, and followed him. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>saying, “Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Jesus rebuked him, saying, <span class="wj">“Be quiet, and come out of him!” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!” <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed by demons. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>All the city was gathered together at the door. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. He didn’t allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there. <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>Simon and those who were with him followed after him; <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>and they found him, and told him, “Everyone is looking for you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="38" class="v">38 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Let’s go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because I came out for this reason.”</span><span id="39" class="v">39 </span>He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="40" class="v">40 </span>A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, “If you want to, you can make me clean.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="41" class="v">41 </span>Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, <span class="wj">“I want to. Be made clean.”</span><span id="42" class="v">42 </span>When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean. <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>He strictly warned him, and immediately sent him out, <span id="44" class="v">44 </span>and said to him, <span class="wj">“See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="45" class="v">45 </span>But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from everywhere.</p>
<p id="2" class="c">2</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>When he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was in the house. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the word to them. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Four people came, carrying a paralytic to him. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>When they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, <span class="wj">“Son, your sins are forgiven you.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>“Why does this man speak blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, <span class="wj">“Why do you reason these things in your hearts? </span><span id="9" class="v">9 </span><span class="wj">Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?’ </span><span id="10" class="v">10 </span><span class="wj">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”</span>—he said to the paralytic— <span id="11" class="v">11 </span><span class="wj">“I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>He arose, and immediately took up the mat, and went out in front of them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>He went out again by the seaside. All the multitude came to him, and he taught them. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>As he passed by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, <span class="wj">“Follow me.”</span> And he arose and followed him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>He was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>The scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, “Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>When Jesus heard it, he said to them, <span class="wj">“Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, “Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don’t fast?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can’t fast. </span><span id="20" class="v">20 </span><span class="wj">But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then will they fast in that day. </span><span id="21" class="v">21 </span><span class="wj">No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made. </span><span id="22" class="v">22 </span><span class="wj">No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine pours out, and the skins will be destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>He was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>The Pharisees said to him, “Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Did you never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry—he, and those who were with him? </span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span><span class="wj">How he entered into God’s house at the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?”</span><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. </span><span id="28" class="v">28 </span><span class="wj">Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”</span></p>
<p id="3" class="c">3</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>He said to the man who had his hand withered, <span class="wj">“Stand up.”</span><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?”</span> But they were silent. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man, <span class="wj">“Stretch out your hand.” </span> He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>The Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea, <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn’t press on him. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, “You are the Son of God!” <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>He went up into the mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach, <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons: <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter); <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>James the son of Zebedee; and John, the brother of James, (whom he called Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder); <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot; <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</p>
<p class="p">Then he came into a house.
    <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>When his friends heard it, they went out to seize him: for they said, “He is insane.” <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>He summoned them, and said to them in parables, <span class="wj">“How can Satan cast out Satan? </span><span id="24" class="v">24 </span><span class="wj">If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. </span><span id="25" class="v">25 </span><span class="wj">If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. </span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span><span class="wj">If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can’t stand, but has an end. </span><span id="27" class="v">27 </span><span class="wj">But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man; and then he will plunder his house. </span><span id="28" class="v">28 </span><span class="wj">Most certainly I tell you, all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme; </span><span id="29" class="v">29 </span><span class="wj">but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation.”<span class="f">+</span></span><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>—because they said, “He has an unclean spirit.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>His mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>A multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, “Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your sisters<span class="f">+</span> are outside looking for you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>He answered them, <span class="wj">“Who are my mother and my brothers?”</span><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, <span class="wj">“Behold, my mother and my brothers! </span><span id="35" class="v">35 </span><span class="wj">For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.”</span></p>
<p id="4" class="c">4</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Again he began to teach by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>He taught them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching, <span id="3" class="v">3 </span><span class="wj">“Listen! Behold, the farmer went out to sow, </span><span id="4" class="v">4 </span><span class="wj">and as he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds</span><span class="f">+</span><span class="wj">came and devoured it. </span><span id="5" class="v">5 </span><span class="wj">Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil. </span><span id="6" class="v">6 </span><span class="wj">When the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. </span><span id="7" class="v">7 </span><span class="wj">Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. </span><span id="8" class="v">8 </span><span class="wj">Others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some produced thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much.”</span><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>He said, <span class="wj">“Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>When he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“To you is given the mystery of God’s Kingdom, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables, </span><span id="12" class="v">12 </span><span class="wj">that ‘seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven them.’”</span><span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Don’t you understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables? </span><span id="14" class="v">14 </span><span class="wj">The farmer sows the word. </span><span id="15" class="v">15 </span><span class="wj">The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them. </span><span id="16" class="v">16 </span><span class="wj">These in the same way are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy. </span><span id="17" class="v">17 </span><span class="wj">They have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble. </span><span id="18" class="v">18 </span><span class="wj">Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word, </span><span id="19" class="v">19 </span><span class="wj">and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. </span><span id="20" class="v">20 </span><span class="wj">Those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Is the lamp brought to be put under a basket </span><span class="f">+</span><span class="wj">or under a bed? Isn’t it put on a stand? </span><span id="22" class="v">22 </span><span class="wj">For there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light. </span><span id="23" class="v">23 </span><span class="wj">If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear. </span><span id="25" class="v">25 </span><span class="wj">For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>He said, <span class="wj">“God’s Kingdom is as if a man should cast seed on the earth, </span><span id="27" class="v">27 </span><span class="wj">and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, though he doesn’t know how. </span><span id="28" class="v">28 </span><span class="wj">For the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. </span><span id="29" class="v">29 </span><span class="wj">But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>He said, <span class="wj">“How will we liken God’s Kingdom? Or with what parable will we illustrate it? </span><span id="31" class="v">31 </span><span class="wj">It’s like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth, </span><span id="32" class="v">32 </span><span class="wj">yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Without a parable he didn’t speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, <span class="wj">“Let’s go over to the other side.”</span><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him. <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled. <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are dying?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="39" class="v">39 </span>He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, <span class="wj">“Peace! Be still!”</span> The wind ceased, and there was a great calm. <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="41" class="v">41 </span>They were greatly afraid, and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”</p>
<p id="5" class="c">5</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>When he had come out of the boat, immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>He lived in the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains, <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him, <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>and crying out with a loud voice, he said, “What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, don’t torment me.” <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>For he said to him, <span class="wj">“Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>He asked him, <span class="wj">“What is your name?”</span></p>
<p class="p">He said to him, “My name is Legion, for we are many.”
    <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Now on the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>All the demons begged him, saying, “Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>At once Jesus gave them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Those who fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the country.</p>
<p class="p">The people came to see what it was that had happened.
    <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Those who saw it declared to them what happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>They began to beg him to depart from their region.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>He didn’t allow him, but said to him, <span class="wj">“Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone marveled.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet, <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>and begged him much, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>A certain woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years, <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse, <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>For she said, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well.” <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked, <span class="wj">“Who touched my clothes?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>His disciples said to him, “You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>He looked around to see her who had done this thing. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>He said to her, <span class="wj">“Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, <span class="wj">“Don’t be afraid, only believe.”</span><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>He came to the synagogue ruler’s house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing. <span id="39" class="v">39 </span>When he had entered in, he said to them, <span class="wj">“Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="40" class="v">40 </span>They ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying. <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>Taking the child by the hand, he said to her, <span class="wj">“Talitha cumi!” </span>  which means, being interpreted, <span class="wj">“Girl, I tell you, get up!” </span><span id="42" class="v">42 </span>Immediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement. <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat.</p>
<p id="6" class="c">6</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>He went out from there. He came into his own country, and his disciples followed him. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>When the Sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get these things?” and, “What is the wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands? <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judah, and Simon? Aren’t his sisters here with us?” They were offended at him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house.”</span><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>He could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people, and healed them. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>He marveled because of their unbelief.</p>
<p class="p">He went around the villages teaching.
    <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>He called to himself the twelve, and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>He commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse, <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>but to wear sandals, and not put on two tunics. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Wherever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there. </span><span id="11" class="v">11 </span><span class="wj">Whoever will not receive you nor hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony against them. Assuredly, I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>They went out and preached that people should repent. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>They cast out many demons, and anointed many with oil who were sick, and healed them. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>King Herod heard this, for his name had become known, and he said, “John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.” <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>But others said, “He is Elijah.” Others said, “He is a prophet, or like one of the prophets.” <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>But Herod, when he heard this, said, “This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead.” <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>For Herod himself had sent out and arrested John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, for he had married her. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>For John said to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.” <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him, but she couldn’t, <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Then a convenient day came, that Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>When the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him. The king said to the young lady, “Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you.” <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>He swore to her, “Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>She went out, and said to her mother, “What shall I ask?”</p>
<p class="p">She said, “The head of John the Baptizer.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>She came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>The king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner guests, he didn’t wish to refuse her. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring John’s head, and he went and beheaded him in the prison, <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>When his disciples heard this, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>The apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“You come apart into a deserted place, and rest awhile.”</span> For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>They went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>They<span class="f">+</span> saw them going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to him. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Jesus came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things. <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him, and said, “This place is deserted, and it is late in the day. <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>But he answered them, <span class="wj">“You give them something to eat.”</span></p>
<p class="p">They asked him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii<span class="f">+</span> worth of bread, and give them something to eat?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="38" class="v">38 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“How many loaves do you have? Go see.”</span></p>
<p class="p">When they knew, they said, “Five, and two fish.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="39" class="v">39 </span>He commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass. <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties. <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all. <span id="42" class="v">42 </span>They all ate, and were filled. <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish. <span id="44" class="v">44 </span>Those who ate the loaves were<span class="f">+</span> five thousand men.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="45" class="v">45 </span>Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away. <span id="46" class="v">46 </span>After he had taken leave of them, he went up the mountain to pray.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="47" class="v">47 </span>When evening had come, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on the land. <span id="48" class="v">48 </span>Seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea, <span class="x">+</span> and he would have passed by them, <span id="49" class="v">49 </span>but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out; <span id="50" class="v">50 </span>for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, <span class="wj">“Cheer up! It is I!</span><span class="f">+</span><span class="wj">Don’t be afraid.”</span><span id="51" class="v">51 </span>He got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled; <span id="52" class="v">52 </span>for they hadn’t understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="53" class="v">53 </span>When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore. <span id="54" class="v">54 </span>When they had come out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him, <span id="55" class="v">55 </span>and ran around that whole region, and began to bring those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard he was. <span id="56" class="v">56 </span>Wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might just touch the fringe<span class="f">+</span> of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well.</p>
<p id="7" class="c">7</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is unwashed, hands, they found fault. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>(For the Pharisees and all the Jews, don’t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>They don’t eat when they come from the marketplace unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.) <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>He answered them, <span class="wj">“Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,</span></p>
<p class="q"><span class="wj">‘This people honors me with their lips,</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">but their heart is far from me.</span></p>
<p class="q"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span><span class="wj">But they worship me in vain,</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’</span><span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span><span class="wj">“For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.”</span><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition. </span><span id="10" class="v">10 </span><span class="wj">For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother;’</span><span class="x">+</span><span class="wj">and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’</span><span class="x">+</span><span id="11" class="v">11 </span><span class="wj">But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban,</span><span class="f">+</span><span class="wj"> that is to say, given to God”;’ </span><span id="12" class="v">12 </span><span class="wj">then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother, </span><span id="13" class="v">13 </span><span class="wj">making void the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like this.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, <span class="wj">“Hear me, all of you, and understand. </span><span id="15" class="v">15 </span><span class="wj">There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man. </span><span id="16" class="v">16 </span><span class="wj">If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”</span><span class="f">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Are you also without understanding? Don’t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can’t defile him, </span><span id="19" class="v">19 </span><span class="wj">because it doesn’t go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus purifying all foods</span><span class="f">+</span><span class="wj">?” </span><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>He said, <span class="wj">“That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man. </span><span id="21" class="v">21 </span><span class="wj">For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts, </span><span id="22" class="v">22 </span><span class="wj">covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness. </span><span id="23" class="v">23 </span><span class="wj">All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>But Jesus said to her, <span class="wj">“Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>He said to her, <span class="wj">“For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the middle of the region of Decapolis. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, <span class="wj">“Ephphatha!” </span>  that is, <span class="wj">“Be opened!”</span><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly. <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it. <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>They were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!”</p>
<p id="8" class="c">8</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>In those days, when there was a very great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to himself, and said to them, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span><span class="wj">“I have compassion on the multitude, because they have stayed with me now three days, and have nothing to eat. </span><span id="3" class="v">3 </span><span class="wj">If I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long way.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>His disciples answered him, “From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted place?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>He asked them, <span class="wj">“How many loaves do you have?”</span></p>
<p class="p">They said, “Seven.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having given thanks, he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the multitude. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>They had a few small fish. Having blessed them, he said to serve these also. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>They ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Those who had eaten were about four thousand. Then he sent them away.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>The Pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and testing him. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>He sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, <span class="wj">“Why does this generation </span><span class="f">+</span><span class="wj">seek a sign? Most certainly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>He left them, and again entering into the boat, departed to the other side. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>They forgot to take bread; and they didn’t have more than one loaf in the boat with them. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>He warned them, saying, <span class="wj">“Take heed: beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>They reasoned with one another, saying, “It’s because we have no bread.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Jesus, perceiving it, said to them, <span class="wj">“Why do you reason that it’s because you have no bread? Don’t you perceive yet, neither understand? Is your heart still hardened? </span><span id="18" class="v">18 </span><span class="wj">Having eyes, don’t you see? Having ears, don’t you hear? Don’t you remember? </span><span id="19" class="v">19 </span><span class="wj">When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?”</span></p>
<p class="p">They told him, “Twelve.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span><span class="wj">“When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?”</span></p>
<p class="p">They told him, “Seven.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>He asked them, <span class="wj">“Don’t you understand yet?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>He came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>He took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village. When he had spat on his eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>He looked up, and said, “I see men; for I see them like trees walking.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Then again he laid his hands on his eyes. He looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone clearly. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>He sent him away to his house, saying, <span class="wj">“Don’t enter into the village, nor tell anyone in the village.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Jesus went out, with his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, <span class="wj">“Who do men say that I am?” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>They told him, “John the Baptizer, and others say Elijah, but others: one of the prophets.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“But who do you say that I am?”</span></p>
<p class="p">Peter answered, “You are the Christ.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>He commanded them that they should tell no one about him. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>He spoke to them openly. Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>But he, turning around, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and said, <span class="wj">“Get behind me, Satan! For you have in mind not the things of God, but the things of men.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>He called the multitude to himself with his disciples, and said to them, <span class="wj">“Whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. </span><span id="35" class="v">35 </span><span class="wj">For whoever wants to save his life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it. </span><span id="36" class="v">36 </span><span class="wj">For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? </span><span id="37" class="v">37 </span><span class="wj">For what will a man give in exchange for his life? </span><span id="38" class="v">38 </span><span class="wj">For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him, when he comes in his Father’s glory, with the holy angels.”</span></p>
<p id="9" class="c">9</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste death until they see God’s Kingdom come with power.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves, and he was changed into another form in front of them. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>His clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Peter answered Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>For he didn’t know what to say, for they were very afraid.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>A cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Suddenly looking around, they saw no one with them any more, except Jesus only.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>As they were coming down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>They kept this saying to themselves, questioning what the “rising from the dead” meant.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>They asked him, saying, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. How is it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be despised? </span><span id="13" class="v">13 </span><span class="wj">But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to, even as it is written about him.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Coming to the disciples, he saw a great multitude around them, and scribes questioning them. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Immediately all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him, greeted him. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>He asked the scribes, <span class="wj">“What are you asking them?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>One of the multitude answered, “Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit; <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>and wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and wastes away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren’t able.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>He answered him, <span class="wj">“Unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>They brought him to him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>He asked his father, <span class="wj">“How long has it been since this has come to him?”</span></p>
<p class="p">He said, “From childhood.
    <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Immediately the father of the child cried out with tears, “I believe. Help my unbelief!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>When Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, <span class="wj">“You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again!”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>After crying out and convulsing him greatly, it came out of him. The boy became like one dead; so much that most of them said, “He is dead.” <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>When he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we cast it out?” <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and fasting.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>They went out from there, and passed through Galilee. He didn’t want anyone to know it. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>For he was teaching his disciples, and said to them, <span class="wj">“The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, on the third day he will rise again.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>But they didn’t understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>He came to Capernaum, and when he was in the house he asked them, <span class="wj">“What were you arguing among yourselves on the way?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>But they were silent, for they had disputed one with another on the way about who was the greatest.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>He sat down, and called the twelve; and he said to them, <span class="wj">“If any man wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.”</span><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>He took a little child, and set him in the middle of them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them, <span id="37" class="v">37 </span><span class="wj">“Whoever receives one such little child in my name, receives me, and whoever receives me, doesn’t receive me, but him who sent me.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="38" class="v">38 </span>John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone who doesn’t follow us casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he doesn’t follow us.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="39" class="v">39 </span>But Jesus said, <span class="wj">“Don’t forbid him, for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me. </span><span id="40" class="v">40 </span><span class="wj">For whoever is not against us is on our side. </span><span id="41" class="v">41 </span><span class="wj">For whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you are Christ’s, most certainly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward. </span><span id="42" class="v">42 </span><span class="wj">Whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if he were thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck. </span><span id="43" class="v">43 </span><span class="wj">If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna, </span><span class="f">+</span><span class="wj">into the unquenchable fire, </span><span id="44" class="v">44 </span><span class="wj">‘where their worm doesn’t die, and the fire is not quenched.’ </span><span class="x">+</span><span class="f">+</span><span id="45" class="v">45 </span><span class="wj">If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off.

<p id="10" class="c">10</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>He arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan. Multitudes came together to him again. As he usually did, he was again teaching them. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Pharisees came to him testing him, and asked him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>He answered, <span class="wj">“What did Moses command you?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>They said, “Moses allowed a certificate of divorce to be written, and to divorce her.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>But Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“For your hardness of heart, he wrote you this commandment. </span><span id="6" class="v">6 </span><span class="wj">But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.</span><span class="x">+</span><span id="7" class="v">7 </span><span class="wj">For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will join to his wife, </span><span id="8" class="v">8 </span><span class="wj">and the two will become one flesh,</span><span class="x">+</span><span class="wj">so that they are no longer two, but one flesh. </span><span id="9" class="v">9 </span><span class="wj">What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>In the house, his disciples asked him again about the same matter. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Whoever divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery against her. </span><span id="12" class="v">12 </span><span class="wj">If a woman herself divorces her husband, and marries another, she commits adultery.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>They were bringing to him little children, that he should touch them, but the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>But when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation, and said to them, <span class="wj">“Allow the little children to come to me! Don’t forbid them, for God’s Kingdom belongs to such as these. </span><span id="15" class="v">15 </span><span class="wj">Most certainly I tell you, whoever will not receive God’s Kingdom like a little child, he will in no way enter into it.”</span><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>He took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands on them.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>As he was going out into the way, one ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, “Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Why do you call me good? No one is good except one—God. </span><span id="19" class="v">19 </span><span class="wj">You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder,’ ‘Do not commit adultery,’ ‘Do not steal,’ ‘Do not give false testimony,’ ‘Do not defraud,’ ‘Honor your father and mother.’”</span><span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>He said to him, “Teacher, I have observed all these things from my youth.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Jesus looking at him loved him, and said to him, <span class="wj">“One thing you lack. Go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>But his face fell at that saying, and he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great possessions. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Jesus looked around, and said to his disciples, <span class="wj">“How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into God’s Kingdom!”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answered again, <span class="wj">“Children, how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter into God’s Kingdom! </span><span id="25" class="v">25 </span><span class="wj">It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>They were exceedingly astonished, saying to him, “Then who can be saved?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Jesus, looking at them, said, <span class="wj">“With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Peter began to tell him, “Behold, we have left all, and have followed you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Jesus said, <span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News, </span><span id="30" class="v">30 </span><span class="wj">but he will receive one hundred times more now in this time, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and land, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life. </span><span id="31" class="v">31 </span><span class="wj">But many who are first will be last; and the last first.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going in front of them, and they were amazed; and those who followed were afraid. He again took the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span><span class="wj">“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles. </span><span id="34" class="v">34 </span><span class="wj">They will mock him, spit on him, scourge him, and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came near to him, saying, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we will ask.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“What do you want me to do for you?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>They said to him, “Grant to us that we may sit, one at your right hand, and one at your left hand, in your glory.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="38" class="v">38 </span>But Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“You don’t know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="39" class="v">39 </span>They said to him, “We are able.”</p>
<p class="p">Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; </span><span id="40" class="v">40 </span><span class="wj">but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="41" class="v">41 </span>When the ten heard it, they began to be indignant towards James and John.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="42" class="v">42 </span>Jesus summoned them, and said to them, <span class="wj">“You know that they who are recognized as rulers over the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. </span><span id="43" class="v">43 </span><span class="wj">But it shall not be so among you, but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant. </span><span id="44" class="v">44 </span><span class="wj">Whoever of you wants to become first among you, shall be bondservant of all. </span><span id="45" class="v">45 </span><span class="wj">For the Son of Man also came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="46" class="v">46 </span>They came to Jericho. As he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road. <span id="47" class="v">47 </span>When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, “Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!” <span id="48" class="v">48 </span>Many rebuked him, that he should be quiet, but he cried out much more, “You son of David, have mercy on me!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="49" class="v">49 </span>Jesus stood still, and said, <span class="wj">“Call him.”</span></p>
<p class="p">They called the blind man, saying to him, “Cheer up! Get up. He is calling you!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="50" class="v">50 </span>He, casting away his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="51" class="v">51 </span>Jesus asked him, <span class="wj">“What do you want me to do for you?”</span></p>
<p class="p">The blind man said to him, “Rabboni,<span class="f">+</span> that I may see again.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="52" class="v">52 </span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Go your way. Your faith has made you well.” </span>  Immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus on the way.</p>
<p id="11" class="c">11</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>When they came near to Jerusalem, to Bethsphage<span class="f">+</span> and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>and said to them, <span class="wj">“Go your way into the village that is opposite you. Immediately as you enter into it, you will find a young donkey tied, on which no one has sat. Untie him, and bring him. </span><span id="3" class="v">3 </span><span class="wj">If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord needs him;’ and immediately he will send him back here.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>They went away, and found a young donkey tied at the door outside in the open street, and they untied him. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Some of those who stood there asked them, “What are you doing, untying the young donkey?” <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>They said to them just as Jesus had said, and they let them go.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>They brought the young donkey to Jesus, and threw their garments on it, and Jesus sat on it. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Many spread their garments on the way, and others were cutting down branches from the trees, and spreading them on the road. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Those who went in front, and those who followed, cried out, “Hosanna!<span class="f">+</span> Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!<span class="x">+</span><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Jesus entered into the temple in Jerusalem. When he had looked around at everything, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>The next day, when they had come out from Bethany, he was hungry. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Jesus told it, <span class="wj">“May no one ever eat fruit from you again!” </span>  and his disciples heard it.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>They came to Jerusalem, and Jesus entered into the temple, and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers’ tables, and the seats of those who sold the doves. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>He would not allow anyone to carry a container through the temple. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>He taught, saying to them, <span class="wj">“Isn’t it written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations?’</span><span class="x">+</span><span class="wj">But you have made it a den of robbers!”</span><span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>The chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him. For they feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>When evening came, he went out of the city. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Peter, remembering, said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered away.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Jesus answered them, <span class="wj">“Have faith in God. </span><span id="23" class="v">23 </span><span class="wj">For most certainly I tell you, whoever may tell this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ and doesn’t doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is happening; he shall have whatever he says. </span><span id="24" class="v">24 </span><span class="wj">Therefore I tell you, all things whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received them, and you shall have them. </span><span id="25" class="v">25 </span><span class="wj">Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father, who is in heaven, may also forgive you your transgressions. </span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span><span class="wj">But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your transgressions.”</span><span class="f">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>They came again to Jerusalem, and as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders came to him, <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>and they began saying to him, “By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this authority to do these things?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. </span><span id="30" class="v">30 </span><span class="wj">The baptism of John—was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>They reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we should say, ‘From heaven;’ he will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>If we should say, ‘From men’”—they feared the people, for all held John to really be a prophet. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>They answered Jesus, “We don’t know.”</p>
<p class="p">Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.”</span></p>
<p id="12" class="c">12</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>He began to speak to them in parables. <span class="wj">“A man planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the wine press, built a tower, rented it out to a farmer, and went into another country. </span><span id="2" class="v">2 </span><span class="wj">When it was time, he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard. </span><span id="3" class="v">3 </span><span class="wj">They took him, beat him, and sent him away empty. </span><span id="4" class="v">4 </span><span class="wj">Again, he sent another servant to them; and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated. </span><span id="5" class="v">5 </span><span class="wj">Again he sent another; and they killed him; and many others, beating some, and killing some. </span><span id="6" class="v">6 </span><span class="wj">Therefore still having one, his beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ </span><span id="7" class="v">7 </span><span class="wj">But those farmers said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ </span><span id="8" class="v">8 </span><span class="wj">They took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. </span><span id="9" class="v">9 </span><span class="wj">What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do?

<p class="q"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span><span class="wj">This was from the Lord,</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">it is marvelous in our eyes’?”</span><span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>They tried to seize him, but they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them. They left him, and went away. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>They sent some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>When they had come, they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don’t defer to anyone; for you aren’t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Shall we give, or shall we not give?”</p>
<p class="p">But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, <span class="wj">“Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>They brought it.</p>
<p class="p">He said to them, <span class="wj">“Whose is this image and inscription?”</span></p>
<p class="p">They said to him, “Caesar’s.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Jesus answered them, <span class="wj">“Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</span></p>
<p class="p">They marveled greatly at him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>There came to him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection. They asked him, saying, <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>“Teacher, Moses wrote to us, ‘If a man’s brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up offspring for his brother.’ <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and dying left no offspring. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>The second took her, and died, leaving no children behind him. The third likewise; <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>and the seven took her and left no children. Last of all the woman also died. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Jesus answered them, <span class="wj">“Isn’t this because you are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God? </span><span id="25" class="v">25 </span><span class="wj">For when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. </span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span><span class="wj">But about the dead, that they are raised; haven’t you read in the book of Moses, about the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?</span><span class="x">+</span><span id="27" class="v">27 </span><span class="wj">He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are therefore badly mistaken.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>One of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together. Knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the greatest of all?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Jesus answered, <span class="wj">“The greatest is, ‘Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one: </span><span id="30" class="v">30 </span><span class="wj">you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’</span><span class="x">+</span><span class="wj">This is the first commandment. </span><span id="31" class="v">31 </span><span class="wj">The second is like this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’</span><span class="x">+</span><span class="wj">There is no other commandment greater than these.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>The scribe said to him, “Truly, teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is none other but he, <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, <span class="wj">“You are not far from God’s Kingdom.”</span></p>
<p class="p">No one dared ask him any question after that.
    <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>Jesus responded, as he taught in the temple, <span class="wj">“How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? </span><span id="36" class="v">36 </span><span class="wj">For David himself said in the Holy Spirit,</span></p>
<p class="q"><span class="wj">‘The Lord said to my Lord,</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">“Sit at my right hand,</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.”’</span><span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span><span class="wj">Therefore David himself calls him Lord, so how can he be his son?” </span></p>
<p class="p">The common people heard him gladly.
    <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>In his teaching he said to them, <span class="wj">“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and to get greetings in the marketplaces, </span><span id="39" class="v">39 </span><span class="wj">and the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts: </span><span id="40" class="v">40 </span><span class="wj">those who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="41" class="v">41 </span>Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury. Many who were rich cast in much. <span id="42" class="v">42 </span>A poor widow came, and she cast in two small brass coins,<span class="f">+</span> which equal a quadrans coin.<span class="f">+</span><span id="43" class="v">43 </span>He called his disciples to himself, and said to them, <span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury, </span><span id="44" class="v">44 </span><span class="wj">for they all gave out of their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live on.”</span></p>
<p id="13" class="c">13</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>As he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone on another, which will not be thrown down.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately, <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>“Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Jesus, answering, began to tell them, <span class="wj">“Be careful that no one leads you astray. </span><span id="6" class="v">6 </span><span class="wj">For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he!’</span><span class="f">+</span><span class="wj">and will lead many astray.</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span><span class="wj">“When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don’t be troubled. For those must happen, but the end is not yet. </span><span id="8" class="v">8 </span><span class="wj">For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places. There will be famines and troubles. These things are the beginning of birth pains. </span><span id="9" class="v">9 </span><span class="wj">But watch yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils.

<p id="14" class="c">14</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread, and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception, and kill him. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>For they said, “Not during the feast, because there might be a riot among the people.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>While he was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard—very costly. She broke the jar, and poured it over his head. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>But there were some who were indignant among themselves, saying, “Why has this ointment been wasted? <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>For this might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii,<span class="f">+</span>  and given to the poor.” They grumbled against her.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>But Jesus said, <span class="wj">“Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for me. </span><span id="7" class="v">7 </span><span class="wj">For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not always have me. </span><span id="8" class="v">8 </span><span class="wj">She has done what she could.

<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>They, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. He sought how he might conveniently deliver him. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>On the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare that you may eat the Passover?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>He sent two of his disciples, and said to them, <span class="wj">“Go into the city, and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him, </span><span id="14" class="v">14 </span><span class="wj">and wherever he enters in, tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’ </span><span id="15" class="v">15 </span><span class="wj">He will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Get ready for us there.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found things as he had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>When it was evening he came with the twelve. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>As they sat and were eating, Jesus said, <span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, one of you will betray me—he who eats with me.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>They began to be sorrowful, and to ask him one by one, “Surely not I?” And another said, “Surely not I?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>He answered them, <span class="wj">“It is one of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish. </span><span id="21" class="v">21 </span><span class="wj">For the Son of Man goes, even as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them, and said, <span class="wj">“Take, eat. This is my body.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>He took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many. </span><span id="25" class="v">25 </span><span class="wj">Most certainly I tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew in God’s Kingdom.”</span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’</span><span class="x">+</span><span id="28" class="v">28 </span><span class="wj">However, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>But Peter said to him, “Although all will be offended, yet I will not.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, that you today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>But he spoke all the more, “If I must die with you, I will not deny you.” They all said the same thing.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>They came to a place which was named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, <span class="wj">“Sit here, while I pray.”</span><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>He took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>He went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him. <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>He said, <span class="wj">“Abba,<span class="f">+</span> Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you desire.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, <span class="wj">“Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn’t you watch one hour? </span><span id="38" class="v">38 </span><span class="wj">Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="39" class="v">39 </span>Again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words. <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>Again he returned, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didn’t know what to answer him. <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>He came the third time, and said to them, <span class="wj">“Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. </span><span id="42" class="v">42 </span><span class="wj">Arise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="43" class="v">43 </span>Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came—and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders. <span id="44" class="v">44 </span>Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, “Whomever I will kiss, that is he. Seize him, and lead him away safely.” <span id="45" class="v">45 </span>When he had come, immediately he came to him, and said, “Rabbi! Rabbi!” and kissed him. <span id="46" class="v">46 </span>They laid their hands on him, and seized him. <span id="47" class="v">47 </span>But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="48" class="v">48 </span>Jesus answered them, <span class="wj">“Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me? </span><span id="49" class="v">49 </span><span class="wj">I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me. But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="50" class="v">50 </span>They all left him, and fled. <span id="51" class="v">51 </span>A certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself over his naked body. The young men grabbed him, <span id="52" class="v">52 </span>but he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked. <span id="53" class="v">53 </span>They led Jesus away to the high priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together with him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="54" class="v">54 </span>Peter had followed him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire. <span id="55" class="v">55 </span>Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, and found none. <span id="56" class="v">56 </span>For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony didn’t agree with each other. <span id="57" class="v">57 </span>Some stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying, <span id="58" class="v">58 </span>“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.’” <span id="59" class="v">59 </span>Even so, their testimony did not agree.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="60" class="v">60 </span>The high priest stood up in the middle, and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is it which these testify against you?” <span id="61" class="v">61 </span>But he stayed quiet, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="62" class="v">62 </span>Jesus said, <span class="wj">“I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="63" class="v">63 </span>The high priest tore his clothes, and said, “What further need have we of witnesses? <span id="64" class="v">64 </span>You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think?” They all condemned him to be worthy of death. <span id="65" class="v">65 </span>Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, “Prophesy!” The officers struck him with the palms of their hands.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="66" class="v">66 </span>As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came, <span id="67" class="v">67 </span>and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, “You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="68" class="v">68 </span>But he denied it, saying, “I neither know, nor understand what you are saying.” He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="69" class="v">69 </span>The maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by, “This is one of them.” <span id="70" class="v">70 </span>But he again denied it. After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, “You truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it.” <span id="71" class="v">71 </span>But he began to curse, and to swear, “I don’t know this man of whom you speak!” <span id="72" class="v">72 </span>The rooster crowed the second time. Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.”</span> When he thought about that, he wept.</p>
<p id="15" class="c">15</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”</p>
<p class="p">He answered, <span class="wj">“So you say.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>The chief priests accused him of many things. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Pilate again asked him, “Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>There was one called Barabbas, bound with his fellow insurgents, men who in the insurrection had committed murder. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?” <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Pilate again asked them, “What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>They cried out again, “Crucify him!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?”</p>
<p class="p">But they cried out exceedingly, “Crucify him!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>They clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>They began to salute him, “Hail, King of the Jews!” <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>When they had mocked him, they took the purple off him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, “The place of a skull.” <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn’t take it.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>It was the third hour,<span class="f">+</span> and they crucified him. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>The superscription of his accusation was written over him, “THE KING OF THE JEWS.” <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>With him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>The Scripture was fulfilled, which says, “He was counted with transgressors.”<span class="f">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, “Ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>save yourself, and come down from the cross!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, “He saved others. He can’t save himself. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him.”<span class="f">+</span> Those who were crucified with him also insulted him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>When the sixth hour<span class="f">+</span> had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.<span class="f">+</span><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <span class="wj">“Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?”</span> which is, being interpreted, <span class="wj">“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</span><span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to take him down.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit. <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. <span id="39" class="v">39 </span>When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="40" class="v">40 </span>There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="42" class="v">42 </span>When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath, <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for God’s Kingdom, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body. <span id="44" class="v">44 </span>Pilate marveled if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long. <span id="45" class="v">45 </span>When he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. <span id="46" class="v">46 </span>He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. <span id="47" class="v">47 </span>Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.</p>
<p id="16" class="c">16</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>They were saying among themselves, “Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?” <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>for it was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>He said to them, “Don’t be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him! <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>They went out,<span class="f">+</span> and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.<span class="f">+<span class="fqa">They told all that had been commanded them briefly to those around Peter. After that, Jesus himself sent them out, from east to west, with the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.</span></span><span id="9" class="v">9 </span><span class="f">+</span>Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>When they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they disbelieved. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>They went away and told it to the rest. They didn’t believe them, either.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn’t believe those who had seen him after he had risen. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Go into all the world, and preach the Good News to the whole creation. </span><span id="16" class="v">16 </span><span class="wj">He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned. </span><span id="17" class="v">17 </span><span class="wj">These signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new languages; </span><span id="18" class="v">18 </span><span class="wj">they will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>So then the Lord,<span class="f">+</span> after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>They went out, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen.</p>
