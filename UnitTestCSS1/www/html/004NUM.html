<p class="p"><span id="44" class="v">44 </span>These are those who were counted, whom Moses and Aaron counted, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men: they were each one for his fathers’ house. <span id="45" class="v">45 </span>So all those who were counted of the children of Israel by their fathers’ houses, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war in Israel; <span id="46" class="v">46 </span>even all those who were counted were six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty. <span id="47" class="v">47 </span>But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not counted among them. <span id="48" class="v">48 </span>For Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="49" class="v">49 </span>“Only the tribe of Levi you shall not count, neither shall you take a census of them among the children of Israel; <span id="50" class="v">50 </span>but appoint the Levites over the Tabernacle of the Testimony, and over all its furnishings, and over all that belongs to it.

<p class="p"><span id="54" class="v">54 </span>Thus the children of Israel did. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so they did.</p>
<p id="2" class="c">2</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“The children of Israel shall encamp every man by his own standard, with the banners of their fathers’ houses: at a distance from the Tent of Meeting shall they encamp around it.”</p>

<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Thus the children of Israel did. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so they encamped by their standards, and so they set out, everyone by their families, according to their fathers’ houses.</p>
<p id="3" class="c">3</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now this is the history of the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that Yahweh spoke with Moses in Mount Sinai. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>These are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests who were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest’s office. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Nadab and Abihu died before Yahweh, when they offered strange fire before Yahweh, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children.

<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>“Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister to him. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>They shall keep his requirements, and the requirements of the whole congregation before the Tent of Meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>They shall keep all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting, and the obligations of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>You shall give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons.

<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>“Behold,<span class="f">+</span> I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn who open the womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine: <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>for all the firstborn are mine. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I made holy to me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and animal. They shall be mine. I am Yahweh.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying, <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>“Count the children of Levi by their fathers’ houses, by their families. You shall count every male from a month old and upward.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Moses counted them according to Yahweh’s word, as he was commanded.</p>

<p class="p"><span id="89" class="v">89 </span>When Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with Yahweh, he heard his voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the Testimony, from between the two cherubim: and he spoke to him.</p>
<p id="8" class="c">8</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Speak to Aaron, and tell him, ‘When you light the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lamp stand.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Aaron did so. He lit its lamps to light the area in front of the lamp stand, as Yahweh commanded Moses. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>This was the workmanship of the lamp stand, beaten work of gold. From its base to its flowers, it was beaten work: according to the pattern which Yahweh had shown Moses, so he made the lamp stand.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>“Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>You shall do this to them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of cleansing on them, let them shave their whole bodies with a razor, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Then let them take a young bull, and its meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil; and another young bull you shall take for a sin offering. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>You shall present the Levites before the Tent of Meeting. You shall assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>You shall present the Levites before Yahweh. The children of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites, <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Yahweh for a wave offering, on the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of Yahweh.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>“The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering to Yahweh, to make atonement for the Levites. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>You shall set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them as a wave offering to Yahweh. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>“After that, the Levites shall go in to do the service of the Tent of Meeting: and you shall cleanse them, and offer them as a wave offering. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>For they are wholly given to me from among the children of Israel; instead of all who open the womb, even the firstborn of all the children of Israel, I have taken them to me. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine, both man and animal. On the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for myself. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the Tent of Meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel; that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come near to the sanctuary.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel did so to the Levites. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the children of Israel did to them. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>The Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them for a wave offering before Yahweh; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>After that, the Levites went in to do their service in the Tent of Meeting before Aaron, and before his sons: as Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>“This is that which belongs to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service in the work of the Tent of Meeting; <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting on the work, and shall serve no more, <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>but shall minister with their brothers in the Tent of Meeting, to perform the duty, and shall do no service. You shall do thus to the Levites concerning their duties.”</p>
<p id="9" class="c">9</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Moreover let the children of Israel keep the Passover in its appointed season. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>On the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, you shall keep it in its appointed season—according to all its statutes, and according to all its ordinances, you shall keep it.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Moses spoke to the children of Israel, that they should keep the Passover. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>They kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>There were certain men, who were unclean because of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Those men said to him, “We are unclean because of the dead body of a man. Why are we kept back, that we may not offer the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season among the children of Israel?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Moses answered them, “Wait, that I may hear what Yahweh will command concerning you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>“Say to the children of Israel, ‘If any man of you or of your generations is unclean by reason of a dead body, or is on a journey far away, he shall still keep the Passover to Yahweh. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>In the second month, on the fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it. According to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and fails to keep the Passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people. Because he didn’t offer the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>“‘If a foreigner lives among you, and desires to keep the Passover to Yahweh; according to the statute of the Passover, and according to its ordinance, so shall he do. You shall have one statute, both for the foreigner, and for him who is born in the land.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>On the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the Tent of the Testimony: and at evening it was over the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>So it was continually. The cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel traveled; and in the place where the cloud remained, there the children of Israel encamped. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>At the commandment of Yahweh, the children of Israel traveled, and at the commandment of Yahweh they encamped. As long as the cloud remained on the tabernacle they remained encamped. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>When the cloud stayed on the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept Yahweh’s command, and didn’t travel. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of Yahweh they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of Yahweh they traveled. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they traveled: or by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they traveled. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Whether it was two days, or a month, or a year that the cloud stayed on the tabernacle, remaining on it, the children of Israel remained encamped, and didn’t travel; but when it was taken up, they traveled. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>At the commandment of Yahweh they encamped, and at the commandment of Yahweh they traveled. They kept Yahweh’s command, at the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.</p>
<p id="10" class="c">10</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Make two trumpets of silver. You shall make them of beaten work. You shall use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>When they blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the door of the Tent of Meeting. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>If they blow just one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to you. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>When you blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall go forward. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall go forward. They shall blow an alarm for their journeys. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>“The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. This shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>When you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets. Then you will be remembered before Yahweh your God, and you will be saved from your enemies.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>“Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God. I am Yahweh your God.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>The children of Israel went forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>They first went forward according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>First, the standard of the camp of the children of Judah went forward according to their armies. Nahshon the son of Amminadab was over his army. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Nethanel the son of Zuar was over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Eliab the son of Helon was over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>The tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bore the tabernacle, went forward. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>The standard of the camp of Reuben went forward according to their armies. Elizur the son of Shedeur was over his army. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai was over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Eliasaph the son of Deuel was over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>The Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary. The others set up the tabernacle before they arrived.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>The standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies. Elishama the son of Ammihud was over his army. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur was over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Abidan the son of Gideoni was over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>The standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rear guard of all the camps, set forward according to their armies. Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai was over his army. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Pagiel the son of Ochran was over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Ahira the son of Enan was over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Thus were the travels of the children of Israel according to their armies; and they went forward.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are journeying to the place of which Yahweh said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us, and we will treat you well; for Yahweh has spoken good concerning Israel.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>He said to him, “I will not go; but I will depart to my own land, and to my relatives.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>He said, “Don’t leave us, please; because you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>It shall be, if you go with us, yes, it shall be, that whatever good Yahweh does to us, we will do the same to you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>They set forward from the Mount of Yahweh three days’ journey. The ark of Yahweh’s covenant went before them three days’ journey, to seek out a resting place for them. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>The cloud of Yahweh was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp. <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>When the ark went forward, Moses said, “Rise up, Yahweh, and let your enemies be scattered! Let those who hate you flee before you!” <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>When it rested, he said, “Return, Yahweh, to the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel.”</p>
<p id="11" class="c">11</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The people were complaining in the ears of Yahweh. When Yahweh heard it, his anger burned; and Yahweh’s fire burned among them, and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>The people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Yahweh, and the fire abated. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>The name of that place was called Taberah,<span class="f">+</span>  because Yahweh’s fire burned among them.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>The mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, “Who will give us meat to eat? <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic; <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>but now we have lost our appetite. There is nothing at all except this manna to look at.” <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>The manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>The people went around, gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it. Its taste was like the taste of fresh oil. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent; and Yahweh’s anger burned greatly; and Moses was displeased. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Moses said to Yahweh, “Why have you treated with your servant so badly? Why haven’t I found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me? <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them out, that you should tell me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which you swore to their fathers?’ <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Where could I get meat to give to all this people? For they weep to me, saying, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.’ <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>If you treat me this way, please kill me right now, if I have found favor in your sight; and don’t let me see my wretchedness.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Yahweh said to Moses, “Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the Spirit which is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you not bear it yourself alone.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>“Say to the people, ‘Sanctify yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, and you will eat meat; for you have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying, “Who will give us meat to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt.” Therefore Yahweh will give you meat, and you will eat. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>You will not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days, <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils, and it is loathsome to you; because you have rejected Yahweh who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, “Why did we come out of Egypt?”’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Moses said, “The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand men on foot; and you have said, ‘I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole month.’ <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient for them?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Yahweh said to Moses, “Has Yahweh’s hand grown short? Now you will see whether my word will happen to you or not.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Moses went out, and told the people Yahweh’s words; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the Tent. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did so no more. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>But two men remained in the camp. The name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested on them; and they were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>A young man ran, and told Moses, and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered, “My lord Moses, forbid them!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all Yahweh’s people were prophets, that Yahweh would put his Spirit on them!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>A wind from Yahweh went out and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits<span class="f">+</span> above the surface of the earth. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>The people rose up all that day, and all of that night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails. He who gathered least gathered ten homers; <span class="f">+</span> and they spread them all out for themselves around the camp. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, Yahweh’s anger burned against the people, and Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>The name of that place was called Kibroth Hattaavah,<span class="f">+</span> because there they buried the people who lusted.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth; and they stayed at Hazeroth.</p>
<p id="12" class="c">12</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>They said, “Has Yahweh indeed spoken only with Moses? Hasn’t he spoken also with us?” And Yahweh heard it.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Now the man Moses was very humble, more than all the men who were on the surface of the earth. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Yahweh spoke suddenly to Moses, to Aaron, and to Miriam, “You three come out to the Tent of Meeting!”</p>
<p class="p">The three of them came out.
    <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forward. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>He said, “Now hear my words. If there is a prophet among you, I, Yahweh, will make myself known to him in a vision. I will speak with him in a dream. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>My servant Moses is not so. He is faithful in all my house. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>With him, I will speak mouth to mouth, even plainly, and not in riddles; and he shall see Yahweh’s form. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?” <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Yahweh’s anger burned against them; and he departed.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>The cloud departed from over the Tent; and behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. Aaron looked at Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, please don’t count this sin against us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother’s womb.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, “Heal her, God, I beg you!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Yahweh said to Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, shouldn’t she be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut up outside of the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days, and the people didn’t travel until Miriam was brought in again. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Afterward the people traveled from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.</p>
<p id="13" class="c">13</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Send men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel. Of every tribe of their fathers, you shall send a man, every one a prince among them.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of Yahweh. All of them were men who were heads of the children of Israel. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>These were their names:</p>
<p class="m">Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.</p>
<p class="m"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.</p>
<p class="m"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.</p>
<p class="m"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.</p>
<p class="m"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun.</p>
<p class="m"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.</p>
<p class="m"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.</p>
<p class="m"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Of the tribe of Joseph, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.</p>
<p class="m"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.</p>
<p class="m"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.</p>
<p class="m"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.</p>
<p class="m"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.</p>
<p class="m"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>These are the names of the men who Moses sent to spy out the land. Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, “Go up this way by the South, and go up into the hill country. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>See the land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many; <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds; <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. Be courageous, and bring some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>They went up by the South, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>They came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it on a staff between two. They also brought some of the pomegranates and figs. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from there. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>They returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>They went and came to Moses, to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them and to all the congregation. They showed them the fruit of the land. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>They told him, and said, “We came to the land where you sent us. Surely it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>However the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. Moreover, we saw the children of Anak there. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Amalek dwells in the land of the South. The Hittite, the Jebusite, and the Amorite dwell in the hill country. The Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along the side of the Jordan.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, “Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>But the men who went up with him said, “We aren’t able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.” <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>They brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the children of Israel, saying, “The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people who we saw in it are men of great stature. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>There we saw the Nephilim,<span class="f">+</span> the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim.<span class="f">+</span> We were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.”</p>
<p id="14" class="c">14</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>All the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>All the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron. The whole congregation said to them, “We wish that we had died in the land of Egypt, or that we had died in this wilderness! <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Why does Yahweh bring us to this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be captured or killed! Wouldn’t it be better for us to return into Egypt?” <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>They said to one another, “Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>They spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, “The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>If Yahweh delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us; a land which flows with milk and honey. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Only don’t rebel against Yahweh, neither fear the people of the land; for they are bread for us. Their defense is removed from over them, and Yahweh is with us. Don’t fear them.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>But all the congregation threatened to stone them with stones.</p>
<p class="p">Yahweh’s glory appeared in the Tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel.
    <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Yahweh said to Moses, “How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have worked among them? <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Moses said to Yahweh, “Then the Egyptians will hear it; for you brought up this people in your might from among them. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>They will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you Yahweh are in the middle of this people; for you Yahweh are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them, and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Now if you killed this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying, <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>‘Because Yahweh was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.’ <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Now please let the power of the Lord<span class="f">+</span> be great, according as you have spoken, saying, <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>‘Yahweh is slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, forgiving iniquity and disobedience; and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation.’ <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Please pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your loving kindness, and according as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Yahweh said, “I have pardoned according to your word: <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with Yahweh’s glory; <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>because all those men who have seen my glory, and my signs, which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not listened to my voice; <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of those who despised me see it. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him I will bring into the land into which he went. His offspring<span class="f">+</span> shall possess it. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Since the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley, tomorrow turn, and go into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.” <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>“How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, that murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Tell them, ‘As I live, says Yahweh, surely as you have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all who were counted of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me, <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>surely you shall not come into the land, concerning which I swore that I would make you dwell therein, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>But your little ones, that you said should be captured or killed, them I will bring in, and they shall know the land which you have rejected. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>Your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your prostitution, until your dead bodies are consumed in the wilderness. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>After the number of the days in which you spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, you will bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you will know my alienation.’ <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>I, Yahweh, have spoken. I will surely do this to all this evil congregation, who are gathered together against me. In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>The men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land, <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>even those men who brought up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Yahweh. <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="39" class="v">39 </span>Moses told these words to all the children of Israel, and the people mourned greatly. <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>They rose up early in the morning, and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, “Behold, we are here, and will go up to the place which Yahweh has promised: for we have sinned.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="41" class="v">41 </span>Moses said, “Why now do you disobey the commandment of Yahweh, since it shall not prosper? <span id="42" class="v">42 </span>Don’t go up, for Yahweh isn’t among you; that you not be struck down before your enemies. <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and you shall fall by the sword, because you turned back from following Yahweh, therefore Yahweh will not be with you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="44" class="v">44 </span>But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain. Nevertheless, the ark of Yahweh’s covenant and Moses didn’t depart out of the camp. <span id="45" class="v">45 </span>Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites who lived in that mountain, and struck them and beat them down, even to Hormah.</p>
<p id="15" class="c">15</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you have come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you, <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>and will make an offering by fire to Yahweh, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a freewill offering, or in your set feasts, to make a pleasant aroma to Yahweh, of the herd, or of the flock; <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>then he who offers his offering shall offer to Yahweh a meal offering of one tenth of an ephah<span class="f">+</span> of fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of oil. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>You shall prepare wine for the drink offering, the fourth part of a hin, with the burnt offering, or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>“‘Or for a ram, you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenths of an ephah<span class="f">+</span> of fine flour mixed with the third part of a hin of oil; <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>and for the drink offering you shall offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>When you prepare a bull for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace offerings to Yahweh; <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>then shall he offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenths of an ephah<span class="f">+</span> of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil: <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>and you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Thus shall it be done for each bull, or for each ram, or for each of the male lambs, or of the young goats. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>According to the number that you shall prepare, so you shall do to everyone according to their number.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>“‘All who are native-born shall do these things in this way, in offering an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>If a stranger lives as a foreigner with you, or whoever may be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh; as you do, so he shall do. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner, a statute forever throughout your generations. As you are, so shall the foreigner be before Yahweh. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner with you.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you come into the land where I bring you, <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up a wave offering to Yahweh. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Of the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a wave offering. As the wave offering of the threshing floor, so you shall heave it. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Of the first of your dough, you shall give to Yahweh a wave offering throughout your generations.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>“‘When you err, and don’t observe all these commandments, which Yahweh has spoken to Moses, <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>even all that Yahweh has commanded you by Moses, from the day that Yahweh gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations; <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>then it shall be, if it was done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bull for a burnt offering, for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh, with its meal offering, and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>The priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire to Yahweh, and their sin offering before Yahweh, for their error. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>All the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, as well as the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them; for with regard to all the people, it was done unwittingly.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>“‘If one person sins unwittingly, then he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>The priest shall make atonement for the soul who errs, when he sins unwittingly before Yahweh, to make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>You shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly, for him who is native-born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>“‘But the soul who does anything with a high hand, whether he is native-born or a foreigner, the same blasphemes Yahweh. That soul shall be cut off from among his people. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>Because he has despised Yahweh’s word, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off. His iniquity shall be on him.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>While the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>They put him in custody, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>Yahweh said to Moses, “The man shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him with stones outside of the camp.” <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>All the congregation brought him outside of the camp, and stoned him to death with stones, as Yahweh commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them that they should make themselves fringes<span class="f">+</span> in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the fringe <span class="f">+</span> of each border a cord of blue: <span id="39" class="v">39 </span>and it shall be to you for a fringe,<span class="f">+</span> that you may look on it, and remember all Yahweh’s commandments, and do them; and that you not follow after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you use to play the prostitute; <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>that you may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God. <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Yahweh your God.”</p>
<p id="16" class="c">16</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took some men. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>They rose up before Moses, with some of the children of Israel, two hundred fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>They assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, “You take too much on yourself, since all the congregation are holy, everyone of them, and Yahweh is among them! Why do you lift yourselves up above Yahweh’s assembly?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>When Moses heard it, he fell on his face. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>He said to Korah and to all his company, “In the morning, Yahweh will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to him. Even him whom he shall choose, he will cause to come near to him. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Do this: take censers, Korah, and all his company; <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>and put fire in them, and put incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow. It shall be that the man whom Yahweh chooses, he shall be holy. You have gone too far, you sons of Levi!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi! <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Is it a small thing to you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of Yahweh’s tabernacle, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them; <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>and that he has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? Do you seek the priesthood also? <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Therefore you and all your company have gathered together against Yahweh! What is Aaron that you murmur against him?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, “We won’t come up! <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but you must also make yourself a prince over us? <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Moreover you haven’t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We won’t come up.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Moses was very angry, and said to Yahweh, “Don’t respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, neither have I hurt one of them.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Moses said to Korah, “You and all your company go before Yahweh, you, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Each man take his censer, and put incense on them, and each man bring before Yahweh his censer, two hundred fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>They each took his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Korah assembled all the congregation opposite them to the door of the Tent of Meeting.</p>
<p class="p">Yahweh’s glory appeared to all the congregation.
    <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>“Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>They fell on their faces, and said, “God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>“Speak to the congregation, saying, ‘Get away from around the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram!’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>He spoke to the congregation, saying, “Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>So they went away from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side. Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, their sons, and their little ones.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Moses said, “Hereby you shall know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works; for they are not from my own mind. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>If these men die the common death of all men, or if they experience what all men experience, then Yahweh hasn’t sent me. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>But if Yahweh makes a new thing, and the ground opens its mouth, and swallows them up, with all that belong to them, and they go down alive into Sheol<span class="f">+</span>; then you shall understand that these men have despised Yahweh.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>As he finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under them split apart. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households, all of Korah’s men, and all their goods. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>So they, and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol.<span class="f">+</span> The earth closed on them, and they perished from among the assembly. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>All Israel that were around them fled at their cry; for they said, “Lest the earth swallow us up!” <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>Fire came out from Yahweh, and devoured the two hundred fifty men who offered the incense.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>“Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter the fire away from the camp; for they are holy, <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>even the censers of these sinners against their own lives. Let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar, for they offered them before Yahweh. Therefore they are holy. They shall be a sign to the children of Israel.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="39" class="v">39 </span>Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burned had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar, <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>to be a memorial to the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger, who isn’t of the offspring<span class="f">+</span> of Aaron, would come near to burn incense before Yahweh, that he not be as Korah, and as his company; as Yahweh spoke to him by Moses.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="41" class="v">41 </span>But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, “You have killed Yahweh’s people!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="42" class="v">42 </span>When the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, They looked toward the Tent of Meeting. Behold, the cloud covered it, and Yahweh’s glory appeared. <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>Moses and Aaron came to the front of the Tent of Meeting. <span id="44" class="v">44 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="45" class="v">45 </span>“Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!” They fell on their faces.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="46" class="v">46 </span>Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, and put fire from off the altar in it, and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from Yahweh! The plague has begun.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="47" class="v">47 </span>Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the middle of the assembly. Behold, the plague has begun among the people. He put on the incense, and made atonement for the people. <span id="48" class="v">48 </span>He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed. <span id="49" class="v">49 </span>Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those who died about the matter of Korah. <span id="50" class="v">50 </span>Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and the plague was stopped.</p>
<p id="17" class="c">17</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Speak to the children of Israel, and take rods from them, one for each fathers’ house, of all their princes according to their fathers’ houses, twelve rods. Write each man’s name on his rod. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>You shall write Aaron’s name on the rod of Levi; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers’ houses. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>You shall lay them up in the Tent of Meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>It shall happen, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud. I will make the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you, cease from me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers’ houses, even twelve rods. Aaron’s rod was among their rods. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Moses laid up the rods before Yahweh in the Tent of the Testimony.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>On the next day, Moses went into the Tent of the Testimony; and behold, Aaron’s rod for the house of Levi had sprouted, budded, produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Moses brought out all the rods from before Yahweh to all the children of Israel. They looked, and each man took his rod.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Yahweh said to Moses, “Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion; that you may make an end of their murmurings against me, that they not die.” <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Moses did so. As Yahweh commanded him, so he did.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>The children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, “Behold, we perish! We are undone! We are all undone! <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Everyone who keeps approaching Yahweh’s tabernacle, dies! Will we all perish?”</p>
<p id="18" class="c">18</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Yahweh said to Aaron, “You and your sons and your fathers’ house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Bring your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, near with you, that they may be joined to you, and minister to you; but you and your sons with you shall be before the Tent of the Testimony. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>They shall keep your commands, and the duty of the whole Tent; only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar, that they not die, neither they, nor you. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>They shall be joined to you, and keep the responsibility of the Tent of Meeting, for all the service of the Tent. A stranger shall not come near to you.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>“You shall perform the duty of the sanctuary and the duty of the altar, that there be no more wrath on the children of Israel. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Behold, I myself have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of Israel. They are a gift to you, dedicated to Yahweh, to do the service of the Tent of Meeting. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>You and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil. You shall serve. I give you the service of the priesthood as a gift. The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Yahweh spoke to Aaron, “Behold, I myself have given you the command of my wave offerings, even all the holy things of the children of Israel. I have given them to you by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, as a portion forever. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>This shall be yours of the most holy things from the fire: every offering of theirs, even every meal offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render to me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>You shall eat of it like the most holy things. Every male shall eat of it. It shall be holy to you.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>“This is yours, too: the wave offering of their gift, even all the wave offerings of the children of Israel. I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, as a portion forever. Everyone who is clean in your house shall eat of it.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>“I have given to you all the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first fruits of them which they give to Yahweh. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to Yahweh, shall be yours. Everyone who is clean in your house shall eat of it.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>“Everything devoted in Israel shall be yours. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Everything that opens the womb, of all flesh which they offer to Yahweh, both of man and animal shall be yours. Nevertheless, you shall surely redeem the firstborn of man, and you shall redeem the firstborn of unclean animals. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>You shall redeem those who are to be redeemed of them from a month old, according to your estimation, for five shekels of money, after the shekel<span class="f">+</span> of the sanctuary, which weighs twenty gerahs.<span class="f">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>“But you shall not redeem the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat. They are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Their meat shall be yours, as the wave offering breast and as the right thigh, it shall be yours. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>All the wave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to Yahweh, I have given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, as a portion forever. It is a covenant of salt forever before Yahweh to you and to your offspring<span class="f">+</span> with you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Yahweh said to Aaron, “You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any portion among them. I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>“To the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the Tent of Meeting. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Henceforth the children of Israel shall not come near the Tent of Meeting, lest they bear sin, and die. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>But the Levites shall do the service of the Tent of Meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations. Among the children of Israel, they shall have no inheritance. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a wave offering to Yahweh, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance. Therefore I have said to them, ‘Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>“Moreover you shall speak to the Levites, and tell them, ‘When you take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall offer up a wave offering of it for Yahweh, a tithe of the tithe. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Your wave offering shall be credited to you, as though it were the grain of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the wine press. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Thus you also shall offer a wave offering to Yahweh of all your tithes, which you receive of the children of Israel; and of it you shall give Yahweh’s wave offering to Aaron the priest. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Out of all your gifts, you shall offer every wave offering of Yahweh, of all its best, even the holy part of it out of it.’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>“Therefore you shall tell them, ‘When you heave its best from it, then it shall be credited to the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor, and as the increase of the wine press. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>You may eat it anywhere, you and your households, for it is your reward in return for your service in the Tent of Meeting. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>You shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved from it its best. You shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that you not die.’”</p>
<p id="19" class="c">19</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded. Tell the children of Israel to bring you a red heifer without spot, in which is no defect, and which was never yoked. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>You shall give her to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her outside of the camp, and one shall kill her before his face. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Eleazar the priest shall take some of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the Tent of Meeting seven times. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>One shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her meat, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>The priest shall take cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the middle of the burning of the heifer. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>He who burns her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>“A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up outside of the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water for impurity. It is a sin offering. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>He who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening. It shall be to the children of Israel, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them, for a statute forever.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>“He who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>He shall purify himself with water on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean; but if he doesn’t purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Whoever touches a dead person, the body of a man who has died, and doesn’t purify himself, defiles Yahweh’s tabernacle; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel; because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean.

<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>“This is the law when a man dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Every open vessel, which has no covering bound on it, is unclean.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>“Whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>“For the unclean, they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin offering; and running water shall be poured into a vessel. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>A clean person shall take hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, on all the vessels, on the persons who were there, and on him who touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>The clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day.

<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>“Whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the soul that touches it shall be unclean until evening.”</p>
<p id="20" class="c">20</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month. The people stayed in Kadesh. Miriam died there, and was buried there. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>There was no water for the congregation; and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>The people quarreled with Moses, and spoke, saying, “We wish that we had died when our brothers died before Yahweh! <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Why have you brought Yahweh’s assembly into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our animals? <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this evil place? It is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and fell on their faces. Yahweh’s glory appeared to them. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>“Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you, and Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it pour out its water. You shall bring water to them out of the rock; so you shall give the congregation and their livestock drink.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Moses took the rod from before Yahweh, as he commanded him. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, “Hear now, you rebels! Shall we bring water out of this rock for you?” <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Moses lifted up his hand, and struck the rock with his rod twice, and water came out abundantly. The congregation and their livestock drank.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you didn’t believe in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with Yahweh, and he was sanctified in them.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying:</p>
<p class="p">“Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the travail that has happened to us;
    <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time. The Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>When we cried to Yahweh, he heard our voice, sent an angel, and brought us out of Egypt. Behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the edge of your border.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>“Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink from the water of the wells. We will go along the king’s highway. We will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed your border.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Edom said to him, “You shall not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>The children of Israel said to him, “We will go up by the highway; and if we drink your water, I and my livestock, then I will give its price. Only let me, without doing anything else, pass through on my feet.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>He said, “You shall not pass through.” Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border, so Israel turned away from him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>They traveled from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying, <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>“Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor; <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son. Aaron shall be taken, and shall die there.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Moses did as Yahweh commanded. They went up into Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son. Aaron died there on the top of the mountain, and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>When all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.</p>
<p id="21" class="c">21</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South, heard that Israel came by the way of Atharim. He fought against Israel, and took some of them captive. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Israel vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, “If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.” <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Yahweh listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. The name of the place was called Hormah.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom The soul of the people was very discouraged because of the journey. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>The people spoke against God, and against Moses, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loathes this light bread.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Yahweh sent venomous snakes among the people, and they bit the people. Many people of Israel died. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>The people came to Moses, and said, “We have sinned, because we have spoken against Yahweh, and against you. Pray to Yahweh, that he take away the serpents from us.” Moses prayed for the people.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Yahweh said to Moses, “Make a venomous snake, and set it on a pole. It shall happen, that everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.” <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it on the pole. If a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked at the serpent of brass, he lived.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in Oboth. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>They traveled from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrise. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>From there they traveled, and encamped in the valley of Zered. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>From there they traveled, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that comes out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Yahweh, “Vaheb in Suphah, the valleys of the Arnon, <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>the slope of the valleys that incline toward the dwelling of Ar, leans on the border of Moab.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>From there they traveled to Beer; that is the well of which Yahweh said to Moses, “Gather the people together, and I will give them water.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Then Israel sang this song:</p>
<p class="q">“Spring up, well! Sing to it,</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>the well, which the princes dug,</p>
<p class="q2">which the nobles of the people dug,</p>
<p class="q">with the scepter, and with their poles.”</p>
<p class="p">From the wilderness they traveled to Mattanah;
    <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth; <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>“Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard. We will not drink of the water of the wells. We will go by the king’s highway, until we have passed your border.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border, but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz. He fought against Israel. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Israel took all these cities. Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Therefore those who speak in proverbs say,</p>
<p class="q">“Come to Heshbon.</p>
<p class="q2">Let the city of Sihon be built and established;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>for a fire has gone out of Heshbon,</p>
<p class="q2">a flame from the city of Sihon.</p>
<p class="q">It has devoured Ar of Moab,</p>
<p class="q2">The lords of the high places of the Arnon.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Woe to you, Moab!</p>
<p class="q2">You are undone, people of Chemosh!</p>
<p class="q">He has given his sons as fugitives,</p>
<p class="q2">and his daughters into captivity,</p>
<p class="q2">to Sihon king of the Amorites.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>We have shot at them.</p>
<p class="q2">Heshbon has perished even to Dibon.</p>
<p class="q">We have laid waste even to Nophah,</p>
<p class="q2">Which reaches to Medeba.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Moses sent to spy out Jazer. They took its villages, and drove out the Amorites who were there. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>They turned and went up by the way of Bashan. Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Yahweh said to Moses, “Don’t fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, with all his people, and his land. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>So they struck him, with his sons and all his people, until there were no survivors; and they possessed his land.</p>
<p id="22" class="c">22</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Moab was very afraid of the people, because they were many. Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now this multitude will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.”</p>
<p class="p">Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.
    <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, “Behold, there is a people who came out of Egypt. Behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and they are staying opposite me. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Please come now therefore curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand. They came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>He said to them, “Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as Yahweh shall speak to me.” The princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>God came to Balaam, and said, “Who are these men with you?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has said to me, <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>‘Behold, the people that has come out of Egypt covers the surface of the earth. Now, come curse me them. Perhaps I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>God said to Balaam, “You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people; for they are blessed.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, “Go to your land; for Yahweh refuses to permit me to go with you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>The princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, “Balaam refuses to come with us.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Balak again sent princes, more, and more honorable than they. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>They came to Balaam, and said to him, “Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, ‘Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me, <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do. Please come therefore, and curse this people for me.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Balaam answered the servants of Balak, “If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can’t go beyond the word of Yahweh my God, to do less or more. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Now therefore, please wait also here this night, that I may know what Yahweh will speak to me more.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you shall do.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>God’s anger burned because he went; and Yahweh’s angel placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned aside out of the way, and went into the field. Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the way. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Then Yahweh’s angel stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall. He struck her again.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Yahweh’s angel went further, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel, and she lay down under Balaam. Balaam’s anger burned, and he struck the donkey with his staff.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have mocked me, I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long until today? Was I ever in the habit of doing so to you?”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “No.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>Then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw Yahweh’s angel standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Yahweh’s angel said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>The donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times. Unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I would have killed you, and saved her alive.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Balaam said to Yahweh’s angel, “I have sinned; for I didn’t know that you stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases you, I will go back again.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>Yahweh’s angel said to Balaam, “Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak.”</p>
<p class="p">So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
    <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border. <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>Balak said to Balaam, “Didn’t I earnestly send to you to call you? Why didn’t you come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="38" class="v">38 </span>Balaam said to Balak, “Behold, I have come to you. Have I now any power at all to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="39" class="v">39 </span>Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth. <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes who were with him. <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>In the morning, Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there part of the people.</p>
<p id="23" class="c">23</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Balaam said to Balak, “Build here seven altars for me, and prepare here seven bulls and seven rams for me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bull and a ram. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Balaam said to Balak, “Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps Yahweh will come to meet me. Whatever he shows me I will tell you.”</p>
<p class="p">He went to a bare height.
    <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>God met Balaam, and he said to him, “I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Yahweh put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>He took up his parable, and said,</p>
<p class="q">“From Aram has Balak brought me,</p>
<p class="q2">the king of Moab from the mountains of the East.</p>
<p class="q">Come, curse Jacob for me.</p>
<p class="q2">Come, defy Israel.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?</p>
<p class="q2">How shall I defy whom Yahweh has not defied?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>For from the top of the rocks I see him.</p>
<p class="q2">From the hills I see him.</p>
<p class="q">Behold, it is a people that dwells alone,</p>
<p class="q2">and shall not be listed among the nations.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Who can count the dust of Jacob,</p>
<p class="q2">or count the fourth part of Israel?</p>
<p class="q">Let me die the death of the righteous!</p>
<p class="q2">Let my last end be like his!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them altogether.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>He answered and said, “Must I not take heed to speak that which Yahweh puts in my mouth?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place, where you may see them. You shall see just part of them, and shall not see them all. Curse them from there for me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>He said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet over there.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Yahweh met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and say this.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>He came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. Balak said to him, “What has Yahweh spoken?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>He took up his parable, and said,</p>
<p class="q">“Rise up, Balak, and hear!</p>
<p class="q2">Listen to me, you son of Zippor.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>God is not a man, that he should lie,</p>
<p class="q2">nor the son of man, that he should repent.</p>
<p class="q">Has he said, and will he not do it?</p>
<p class="q2">Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Behold, I have received a command to bless.</p>
<p class="q2">He has blessed, and I can’t reverse it.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>He has not seen iniquity in Jacob.</p>
<p class="q2">Neither has he seen perverseness in Israel.</p>
<p class="q">Yahweh his God is with him.</p>
<p class="q2">The shout of a king is among them.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>God brings them out of Egypt.</p>
<p class="q2">He has as it were the strength of the wild ox.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob;</p>
<p class="q2">Neither is there any divination with Israel.</p>
<p class="q">Now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel,</p>
<p class="q2">‘What has God done!’</p>
<p class="q"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Behold, the people rises up as a lioness.</p>
<p class="q2">As a lion he lifts himself up.</p>
<p class="q">He shall not lie down until he eats of the prey,</p>
<p class="q2">and drinks the blood of the slain.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>But Balaam answered Balak, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘All that Yahweh speaks, that I must do?’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Balak said to Balaam, “Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down on the desert. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.</p>
<p id="24" class="c">24</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>When Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel, he didn’t go, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came on him. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>He took up his parable, and said,</p>
<p class="q">“Balaam the son of Beor says,</p>
<p class="q2">the man whose eyes are open says;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>he says, who hears the words of God,</p>
<p class="q2">who sees the vision of the Almighty,</p>
<p class="q2">falling down, and having his eyes open:</p>
<p class="q"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>How goodly are your tents, Jacob,</p>
<p class="q2">and your tents, Israel!</p>
<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>As valleys they are spread out,</p>
<p class="q2">as gardens by the riverside,</p>
<p class="q2">as aloes which Yahweh has planted,</p>
<p class="q2">as cedar trees beside the waters.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Water shall flow from his buckets.</p>
<p class="q2">His seed shall be in many waters.</p>
<p class="q">His king shall be higher than Agag.</p>
<p class="q2">His kingdom shall be exalted.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>God brings him out of Egypt.</p>
<p class="q2">He has as it were the strength of the wild ox.</p>
<p class="q">He shall eat up the nations his adversaries,</p>
<p class="q2">shall break their bones in pieces,</p>
<p class="q2">and pierce them with his arrows.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>He couched, he lay down as a lion,</p>
<p class="q2">as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?</p>
<p class="q">Everyone who blesses you is blessed.</p>
<p class="q2">Everyone who curses you is cursed.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Balak’s anger burned against Balaam, and he struck his hands together. Balak said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Therefore now flee you to your place! I thought to promote you to great honor; but, behold, Yahweh has kept you back from honor.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Balaam said to Balak, “Didn’t I also tell your messengers who you sent to me, saying, <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>‘If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can’t go beyond Yahweh’s word, to do either good or bad of my own mind. I will say what Yahweh says’? <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Now, behold, I go to my people. Come, I will inform you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>He took up his parable, and said,</p>
<p class="q">“Balaam the son of Beor says,</p>
<p class="q2">the man whose eyes are open says;</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>he says, who hears the words of God,</p>
<p class="q2">knows the knowledge of the Most High,</p>
<p class="q2">and who sees the vision of the Almighty,</p>
<p class="q2">Falling down, and having his eyes open:</p>
<p class="q"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>I see him, but not now.</p>
<p class="q2">I see him, but not near.</p>
<p class="q">A star will come out of Jacob.</p>
<p class="q2">A scepter will rise out of Israel,</p>
<p class="q">and shall strike through the corners of Moab,</p>
<p class="q2">and break down all the sons of Sheth.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Edom shall be a possession.</p>
<p class="q2">Seir, his enemies, also shall be a possession,</p>
<p class="q2">while Israel does valiantly.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Out of Jacob shall one have dominion,</p>
<p class="q2">and shall destroy the remnant from the city.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>He looked at Amalek, and took up his parable, and said,</p>
<p class="q">“Amalek was the first of the nations,</p>
<p class="q2">But his latter end shall come to destruction.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>He looked at the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said,</p>
<p class="q">“Your dwelling place is strong.</p>
<p class="q2">Your nest is set in the rock.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted,</p>
<p class="q2">until Asshur carries you away captive.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>He took up his parable, and said,</p>
<p class="q">“Alas, who shall live when God does this?</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim.</p>
<p class="q">They shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber.</p>
<p class="q2">He also shall come to destruction.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.</p>
<p id="25" class="c">25</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Israel stayed in Shittim; and the people began to play the prostitute with the daughters of Moab; <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods. The people ate and bowed down to their gods. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Israel joined himself to Baal Peor. Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Yahweh said to Moses, “Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up to Yahweh before the sun, that the fierce anger of Yahweh may turn away from Israel.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Everyone kill his men who have joined themselves to Baal Peor.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the Tent of Meeting. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the middle of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>He went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>“Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I didn’t consume the children of Israel in my jealousy. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Therefore say, ‘Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>It shall be to him, and to his offspring<span class="f">+</span> after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers’ house among the Simeonites. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>The name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur. He was head of the people of a fathers’ house in Midian.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>“Harass the Midianites, and strike them, <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>for they harassed you with their wiles, with which they have deceived you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.”</p>
<p id="26" class="c">26</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>After the plague, Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers’ houses, all who are able to go out to war in Israel.” <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying, <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>“Take a census, from twenty years old and upward; as Yahweh commanded Moses and the children of Israel.”</p>
<p class="p">These are those that came out of the land of Egypt.

<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>“But the vow of a widow, or of her who is divorced, everything with which she has bound her soul, shall stand against her.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>“If she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath, <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and didn’t disallow her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them, then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand. Her husband has made them void. Yahweh will forgive her. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows, or all her bonds, which are on her.

<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>These are the statutes which Yahweh commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father’s house.</p>

<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Avenge the children of Israel for the Midianites. Afterward you shall be gathered to your people.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Moses spoke to the people, saying, “Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute Yahweh’s vengeance on Midian. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Of every tribe one thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, you shall send to the war.” <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Moses sent them, one thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>They fought against Midian, as Yahweh commanded Moses. They killed every male. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>The children of Israel took the women of Midian captive with their little ones; and all their livestock, all their flocks, and all their goods, they took as plunder. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>All their cities in the places in which they lived, and all their encampments, they burned with fire. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>They took all the captives, and all the plunder, both of man and of animal. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>They brought the captives, and the prey, and the plunder, to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went out to meet them outside of the camp. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Moses said to them, “Have you saved all the women alive? <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against Yahweh in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of Yahweh. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>But all the girls, who have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>“Encamp outside of the camp seven days. Whoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, you and your captives. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>As to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats’ hair, and all things made of wood, you shall purify yourselves.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle, “This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded Moses: <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>however the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead, <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>everything that may withstand the fire, you shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity. All that doesn’t withstand the fire you shall make to go through the water. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>You shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean. Afterward you shall come into the camp.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>“Count the plunder that was taken, both of man and of animal, you, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the congregation; <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>and divide the plunder into two parts: between the men skilled in war, who went out to battle, and all the congregation. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Levy a tribute to Yahweh of the men of war who went out to battle: one soul of five hundred; of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Take it from their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest, for Yahweh’s wave offering. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Of the children of Israel’s half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, of all the livestock, and give them to the Levites, who perform the duty of Yahweh’s tabernacle.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Yahweh commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Now the plunder, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep, <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>and seventy-two thousand head of cattle, <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>and sixty-one thousand donkeys, <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of the women who had not known man by lying with him. <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>The half, which was the portion of those who went out to war, was in number three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep: <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>and Yahweh’s tribute of the sheep was six hundred seventy-five. <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>The cattle were thirty-six thousand; of which Yahweh’s tribute was seventy-two. <span id="39" class="v">39 </span>The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred; of which Yahweh’s tribute was sixty-one. <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>The persons were sixteen thousand; of whom Yahweh’s tribute was thirty-two persons. <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>Moses gave the tribute, which was Yahweh’s wave offering, to Eleazar the priest, as Yahweh commanded Moses. <span id="42" class="v">42 </span>Of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided off from the men who fought <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>(now the congregation’s half was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep, <span id="44" class="v">44 </span>and thirty-six thousand head of cattle, <span id="45" class="v">45 </span>and thirty thousand five hundred donkeys, <span id="46" class="v">46 </span>and sixteen thousand persons), <span id="47" class="v">47 </span>even of the children of Israel’s half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of animal, and gave them to the Levites, who performed the duty of Yahweh’s tabernacle; as Yahweh commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="48" class="v">48 </span>The officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near to Moses. <span id="49" class="v">49 </span>They said to Moses, “Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our command, and there lacks not one man of us. <span id="50" class="v">50 </span>We have brought Yahweh’s offering, what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, armlets, and bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and necklaces, to make atonement for our souls before Yahweh.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="51" class="v">51 </span>Moses and Eleazar the priest took their gold, even all worked jewels. <span id="52" class="v">52 </span>All the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to Yahweh, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels.<span class="f">+</span><span id="53" class="v">53 </span>The men of war had taken booty, every man for himself. <span id="54" class="v">54 </span>Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the Tent of Meeting, for a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh.</p>
<p id="32" class="c">32</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock. When they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that behold, the place was a place for livestock; <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying, <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon, <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>the land which Yahweh struck before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock; and your servants have livestock.” <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>They said, “If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession. Don’t bring us over the Jordan.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Moses said to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, “Shall your brothers go to the war, and shall you sit here? <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Why do you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which Yahweh has given them? <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Your fathers did so when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which Yahweh had given them. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Yahweh’s anger burned in that day, and he swore, saying, <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>‘Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me, <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have followed Yahweh completely.’ <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel, and he made them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, who had done evil in Yahweh’s sight, was consumed.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>“Behold, you have risen up in your fathers’ place, an increase of sinful men, to increase the fierce anger of Yahweh toward Israel. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all these people.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>They came near to him, and said, “We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones; <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place. Our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel have each inherited their inheritance. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward; because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Moses said to them, “If you will do this thing, if you will arm yourselves to go before Yahweh to the war, <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before Yahweh, until he has driven out his enemies from before him, <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>and the land is subdued before Yahweh; then afterward you shall return, and be guiltless towards Yahweh, and towards Israel; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Yahweh.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>“But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against Yahweh; and be sure your sin will find you out. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Build cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>The children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, “Your servants will do as my lord commands. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock, shall be there in the cities of Gilead; <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before Yahweh to battle, as my lord says.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>So Moses commanded concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers’ households of the tribes of the children of Israel. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Moses said to them, “If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man who is armed to battle, before Yahweh, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession; <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>The children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, “As Yahweh has said to your servants, so will we do. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>We will pass over armed before Yahweh into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to its cities and borders, even the cities of the surrounding land. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>The children of Gad built Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>Atrothshophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran: fortified cities, and folds for sheep. <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>The children of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>Nebo, and Baal Meon, (their names being changed), and Sibmah. They gave other names to the cities which they built. <span id="39" class="v">39 </span>The children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were therein. <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he lived therein. <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its villages, and called them Havvoth Jair. <span id="42" class="v">42 </span>Nobah went and took Kenath, and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name.</p>
<p id="33" class="c">33</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>These are the journeys of the children of Israel, when they went out of the land of Egypt by their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Yahweh. These are their journeys according to their goings out. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>They traveled from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the next day after the Passover, the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians, <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, whom Yahweh had struck among them. Yahweh also executed judgments on their gods. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>The children of Israel traveled from Rameses, and encamped in Succoth. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>They traveled from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>They traveled from Etham, and turned back to Pihahiroth, which is before Baal Zephon: and they encamped before Migdol. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>They traveled from before Hahiroth, and crossed through the middle of the sea into the wilderness.

<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>“‘But if he struck him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>If he struck him with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death.

He is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meets him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>“‘But if he shoved him suddenly without hostility, or hurled on him anything without lying in wait, <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him, and cast it on him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm; <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>then the congregation shall judge between the striker and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>The congregation shall deliver the man slayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, where he had fled.

<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The heads of the fathers’ households of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers’ households of the children of Israel. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>They said, “Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel. My lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>If they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong. So will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>When the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong. So their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Moses commanded the children of Israel according to Yahweh’s word, saying, “The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks right. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>This is the thing which Yahweh does command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, ‘Let them be married to whom they think best; only they shall marry into the family of the tribe of their father. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel move from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall all keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may each possess the inheritance of his fathers. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>So shall no inheritance move from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall each keep his own inheritance.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>The daughters of Zelophehad did as Yahweh commanded Moses: <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>for Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their father’s brothers’ sons. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph. Their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>These are the commandments and the ordinances which Yahweh commanded by Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.</p>
