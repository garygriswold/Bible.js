<p class="mt">Paul’s Second Letter to Timothy</p>
<p id="1" class="c">1</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy; <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God, <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>For this cause I also suffer these things.</p>
<p class="p">Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain, <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>(the Lord grant to him to find the Lord’s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.</p>
<p id="2" class="c">2</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn’t crowned unless he has competed by the rules. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>The farmer who labors must be the first to get a share of the crops. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the offspring<span class="f">+ or, seed</span> of David, according to my Good News, <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God’s word isn’t chained. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>This saying is trustworthy:</p>
<p class="q">“For if we died with him,</p>
<p class="q2">we will also live with him.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>If we endure,</p>
<p class="q2">we will also reign with him.</p>
<p class="q">If we deny him,</p>
<p class="q2">he also will deny us.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>If we are faithless,</p>
<p class="q2">he remains faithful.</p>
<p class="q2">For he can’t deny himself.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don’t argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness, <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>However God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal, “The Lord knows those who are his,”<span class="x">+ Numbers 16:5</span> and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord<span class="f">+ TR reads “Christ” instead of “the Lord”</span> depart from unrighteousness.” <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every good work.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient, <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth, <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to his will.</p>
<p id="3" class="c">3</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, not lovers of good, <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>holding a form of godliness, but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>For some of these are people who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith are rejected. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness, <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Every Scripture is God-breathed and<span class="f">+ or, Every writing inspired by God is</span> profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.</p>
<p id="4" class="c">4</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom: <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts; <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Be diligent to come to me soon, <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds, <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>
