<p class="q"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked,</p>
<p class="q2">nor stand on the path of sinners,</p>
<p class="q2">nor sit in the seat of scoffers;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>but his delight is in Yahweh’s<span class="f">+</span> law.</p>
<p class="q2">On his law he meditates day and night.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water,</p>
<p class="q2">that produces its fruit in its season,</p>

<p class="q2">Whatever he does shall prosper.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>The wicked are not so,</p>
<p class="q2">but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,</p>
<p class="q2">nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous,</p>
<p class="q2">but the way of the wicked shall perish.</p>
<p id="2" class="c">2</p>
<p class="q"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Why do the nations rage,</p>
<p class="q2">and the peoples plot a vain thing?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>The kings of the earth take a stand,</p>
<p class="q2">and the rulers take counsel together,</p>
<p class="q2">against Yahweh, and against his Anointed,<span class="f">+</span> saying,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>“Let’s break their bonds apart,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>He who sits in the heavens will laugh.</p>
<p class="q2">The Lord<span class="f">+</span> will have them in derision.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Then he will speak to them in his anger,</p>
<p class="q2">and terrify them in his wrath:</p>
<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>“Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of Zion.”</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>I will tell of the decree.</p>
<p class="q">Yahweh said to me, “You are my son.</p>
<p class="q2">Today I have become your father.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance,</p>
<p class="q2">the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>You shall break them with a rod of iron.</p>
<p class="q2">You shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”</p>
<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Now therefore be wise, you kings.</p>
<p class="q2">Be instructed, you judges of the earth.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Serve Yahweh with fear,</p>
<p class="q2">and rejoice with trembling.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Give sincere homage to the Son,<span class="f">+</span> lest he be angry, and you perish on the way,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Give ear to my words, Yahweh.</p>
<p class="q2">Consider my meditation.</p>

<p class="q2">Evil can’t live with you.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>The arrogant shall not stand in your sight.</p>
<p class="q2">You hate all workers of iniquity.</p>

<p class="q"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Yahweh, don’t rebuke me in your anger,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>So they ate, and were well filled.</p>
<p class="q2">He gave them their own desire.</p>

<p class="q2">They returned and sought God earnestly.</p>

<p class="q2">neither were they faithful in his covenant.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="38" class="v">38 </span>But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them.</p>
<p class="q2">Yes, many times he turned his anger away,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="40" class="v">40 </span>How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="41" class="v">41 </span>They turned again and tempted God,</p>
<p class="q2">and provoked the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="42" class="v">42 </span>They didn’t remember his hand,</p>

<p class="q2">and their streams, so that they could not drink.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="45" class="v">45 </span>He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;</p>

<p class="q"><span id="46" class="v">46 </span>He gave also their increase to the caterpillar,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="47" class="v">47 </span>He destroyed their vines with hail,</p>
<p class="q2">their sycamore fig trees with frost.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="48" class="v">48 </span>He gave over their livestock also to the hail,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="49" class="v">49 </span>He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,</p>
<p class="q2">wrath, indignation, and trouble,</p>
<p class="q2">and a band of angels of evil.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="50" class="v">50 </span>He made a path for his anger.</p>
<p class="q2">He didn’t spare their soul from death,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="51" class="v">51 </span>and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,</p>
<p class="q2">the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="52" class="v">52 </span>But he led out his own people like sheep,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="53" class="v">53 </span>He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid,</p>
<p class="q2">but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="54" class="v">54 </span>He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,</p>
<p class="q2">to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="55" class="v">55 </span>He also drove out the nations before them,</p>
<p class="q2">allotted them for an inheritance by line,</p>
<p class="q2">and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="56" class="v">56 </span>Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,</p>
<p class="q2">and didn’t keep his testimonies;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="57" class="v">57 </span>but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.</p>
<p class="q2">They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="58" class="v">58 </span>For they provoked him to anger with their high places,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="59" class="v">59 </span>When God heard this, he was angry,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="60" class="v">60 </span>So that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh,</p>
<p class="q2">the tent which he placed among men;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="61" class="v">61 </span>and delivered his strength into captivity,</p>
<p class="q2">his glory into the adversary’s hand.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="62" class="v">62 </span>He also gave his people over to the sword,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="63" class="v">63 </span>Fire devoured their young men.</p>
<p class="q2">Their virgins had no wedding song.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="64" class="v">64 </span>Their priests fell by the sword,</p>
<p class="q2">and their widows couldn’t weep.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="65" class="v">65 </span>Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,</p>
<p class="q2">like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="66" class="v">66 </span>He struck his adversaries backward.</p>
<p class="q2">He put them to a perpetual reproach.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="67" class="v">67 </span>Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,</p>
<p class="q2">and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,</p>

<p class="q2">Mount Zion which he loved.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="69" class="v">69 </span>He built his sanctuary like the heights,</p>
<p class="q2">like the earth which he has established forever.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="70" class="v">70 </span>He also chose David his servant,</p>

<p class="q2">he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>They joined themselves also to Baal Peor,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>They didn’t destroy the peoples,</p>
<p class="q2">as Yahweh commanded them,</p>

<p class="q2">and learned their works.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>They served their idols,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="38" class="v">38 </span>They shed innocent blood,</p>

<p class="q2">The land was polluted with blood.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="39" class="v">39 </span>Thus were they defiled with their works,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="40" class="v">40 </span>Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people.</p>
<p class="q2">He abhorred his inheritance.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="41" class="v">41 </span>He gave them into the hand of the nations.</p>
<p class="q2">Those who hated them ruled over them.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="42" class="v">42 </span>Their enemies also oppressed them.</p>
