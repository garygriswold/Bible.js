<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Yahweh’s<span class="f">+ “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.</span> word that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Hear, you peoples, all of you.</p>
<p class="q2">Listen, O earth, and all that is therein:</p>
<p class="q">and let the Lord<span class="f">+ The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”</span> Yahweh be witness against you,</p>
<p class="q2">the Lord from his holy temple.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>For, behold,<span class="f">+ “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span> Yahweh comes out of his place,</p>
<p class="q2">and will come down and tread on the high places of the earth.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>The mountains melt under him,</p>
<p class="q2">and the valleys split apart,</p>
<p class="q2">like wax before the fire,</p>
<p class="q2">like waters that are poured down a steep place.</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>“All this is for the disobedience of Jacob,</p>
<p class="q2">and for the sins of the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="q">What is the disobedience of Jacob?</p>
<p class="q2">Isn’t it Samaria?</p>
<p class="q">And what are the high places of Judah?</p>
<p class="q2">Aren’t they Jerusalem?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Therefore I will make Samaria like a rubble heap of the field,</p>
<p class="q2">like places for planting vineyards;</p>
<p class="q">and I will pour down its stones into the valley,</p>
<p class="q2">and I will uncover its foundations.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>All her idols will be beaten to pieces,</p>
<p class="q2">and all her temple gifts will be burned with fire,</p>
<p class="q2">and all her images I will destroy;</p>
<p class="q">for of the hire of a prostitute has she gathered them,</p>
<p class="q2">and to the hire of a prostitute shall they return.”</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>For this I will lament and wail;</p>
<p class="q2">I will go stripped and naked;</p>
<p class="q2">I will howl like the jackals,</p>
<p class="q2">and moan like the daughters of owls.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>For her wounds are incurable;</p>

<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Don’t tell it in Gath.</p>
<p class="q2">Don’t weep at all.</p>
<p class="q2">At Beth Ophrah<span class="f">+ Beth Ophrah means literally “House of Dust.”</span> I have rolled myself in the dust.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Pass on, inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame.</p>
<p class="q2">The inhabitant of Zaanan won’t come out.</p>
<p class="q2">The wailing of Beth Ezel will take from you his protection.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>For the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good,</p>

<p class="q2">She was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion;</p>
<p class="q2">For the transgressions of Israel were found in you.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Therefore you will give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath.</p>
<p class="q2">The houses of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel.</p>

<p id="2" class="c">2</p>
<p class="q"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Woe to those who devise iniquity</p>
<p class="q2">and work evil on their beds!</p>
<p class="q">When the morning is light, they practice it,</p>
<p class="q2">because it is in the power of their hand.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>They covet fields, and seize them;</p>
<p class="q2">and houses, and take them away:</p>
<p class="q2">and they oppress a man and his house,</p>
<p class="q2">even a man and his heritage.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Therefore Yahweh says:</p>
<p class="q">“Behold, I am planning against these people a disaster,</p>
<p class="q2">from which you will not remove your necks,</p>
<p class="q2">neither will you walk haughtily;</p>
<p class="q2">for it is an evil time.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>In that day they will take up a parable against you,</p>
<p class="q2">and lament with a doleful lamentation, saying,</p>
<p class="q2">‘We are utterly ruined!</p>
<p class="q2">My people’s possession is divided up.</p>
<p class="q2">Indeed he takes it from me and assigns our fields to traitors!’”</p>
<p class="q"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot in Yahweh’s assembly.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>“Don’t prophesy!”</p>
<p class="q2">They prophesy.</p>
<p class="q">“Don’t prophesy about these things.</p>
<p class="q2">Disgrace won’t overtake us.”</p>
<p class="q"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Shall it be said, O house of Jacob:</p>
<p class="q2">“Is Yahweh’s Spirit angry?</p>
<p class="q2">Are these his doings?</p>
<p class="q2">Don’t my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?”</p>
<p class="q"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>But lately my people have risen up as an enemy.</p>
<p class="q2">You strip the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care, returning from battle.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>You drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses;</p>
<p class="q2">from their young children you take away my blessing forever.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Arise, and depart!</p>
<p class="q2">For this is not your resting place,</p>
<p class="q2">because of uncleanness that destroys,</p>
<p class="q2">even with a grievous destruction.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies:</p>
<p class="q2">“I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink”;</p>
<p class="q2">he would be the prophet of this people.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>I will surely assemble, Jacob, all of you;</p>
<p class="q2">I will surely gather the remnant of Israel;</p>
<p class="q">I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah,</p>
<p class="q2">as a flock in the middle of their pasture;</p>
<p class="q2">they will swarm with people.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>He who breaks open the way goes up before them.</p>
<p class="q2">They break through the gate, and go out.</p>
<p class="q2">And their king passes on before them,</p>
<p class="q2">with Yahweh at their head.</p>
<p id="3" class="c">3</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>I said,</p>
<p class="q">“Please listen, you heads of Jacob,</p>
<p class="q2">and rulers of the house of Israel:</p>
<p class="q2">Isn’t it for you to know justice?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>You who hate the good,</p>
<p class="q2">and love the evil;</p>
<p class="q2">who tear off their skin,</p>
<p class="q2">and their flesh from off their bones;</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>who also eat the flesh of my people,</p>
<p class="q2">and flay their skin from off them,</p>
<p class="q2">and break their bones,</p>
<p class="q2">and chop them in pieces, as for the pot,</p>
<p class="q2">and as meat within the cauldron.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Then they will cry to Yahweh,</p>
<p class="q2">but he will not answer them.</p>
<p class="q">Yes, he will hide his face from them at that time,</p>
<p class="q2">because they made their deeds evil.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Yahweh says concerning the prophets who lead my people astray; for those who feed their teeth, they proclaim, “Peace!” and whoever doesn’t provide for their mouths, they prepare war against him:</p>
<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>“Therefore night is over you, with no vision,</p>
<p class="q2">and it is dark to you, that you may not divine;</p>
<p class="q2">and the sun will go down on the prophets,</p>
<p class="q2">and the day will be black over them.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>The seers shall be disappointed,</p>
<p class="q2">and the diviners confounded.</p>
<p class="q">Yes, they shall all cover their lips;</p>
<p class="q2">for there is no answer from God.”<span class="f">+ The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</span></p>
<p class="q"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>But as for me, I am full of power by Yahweh’s Spirit,</p>
<p class="q2">and of judgment, and of might,</p>
<p class="q2">to declare to Jacob his disobedience,</p>
<p class="q2">and to Israel his sin.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Please listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob,</p>
<p class="q2">and rulers of the house of Israel,</p>
<p class="q2">who abhor justice,</p>
<p class="q2">and pervert all equity.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>They build up Zion with blood,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Her leaders judge for bribes,</p>
<p class="q2">and her priests teach for a price,</p>
<p class="q2">and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money:</p>
<p class="q">yet they lean on Yahweh, and say,</p>
<p class="q2">“Isn’t Yahweh among us?</p>
<p class="q2">No disaster will come on us.”</p>
<p class="q"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field,</p>
<p class="q2">and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble,</p>
<p class="q2">and the mountain of the temple like the high places of a forest.</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p id="4" class="c">4</p>
<p class="q"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>But in the latter days,</p>
<p class="q2">it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh’s temple will be established on the top of the mountains,</p>
<p class="q2">and it will be exalted above the hills;</p>
<p class="q2">and peoples will stream to it.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Many nations will go and say,</p>
<p class="q2">“Come, and let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh,</p>
<p class="q2">and to the house of the God of Jacob;</p>
<p class="q2">and he will teach us of his ways,</p>
<p class="q2">and we will walk in his paths.”</p>
<p class="q">For the law will go out of Zion,</p>
<p class="q2">and Yahweh’s word from Jerusalem;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>and he will judge between many peoples,</p>
<p class="q2">and will decide concerning strong nations afar off.</p>
<p class="q2">They will beat their swords into plowshares,</p>
<p class="q2">and their spears into pruning hooks.</p>
<p class="q">Nation will not lift up sword against nation,</p>
<p class="q2">neither will they learn war any more.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>But they will sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree;</p>
<p class="q2">and no one will make them afraid:</p>
<p class="q2">For the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken.
    <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods;</p>
<p class="q2">but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>“In that day,” says Yahweh,</p>
<p class="q2">“I will assemble that which is lame,</p>
<p class="q2">and I will gather that which is driven away,</p>
<p class="q2">and that which I have afflicted;</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>and I will make that which was lame a remnant,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Now why do you cry out aloud?</p>
<p class="q2">Is there no king in you?</p>
<p class="q2">Has your counselor perished,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Be in pain, and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion,</p>
<p class="q2">like a woman in travail;</p>
<p class="q2">for now you will go out of the city,</p>
<p class="q2">and will dwell in the field,</p>
<p class="q2">and will come even to Babylon.</p>
<p class="q">There you will be rescued.</p>
<p class="q2">There Yahweh will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Now many nations have assembled against you, that say,</p>
<p class="q2">“Let her be defiled,</p>
<p class="q2">and let our eye gloat over Zion.”</p>
<p class="q"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>But they don’t know the thoughts of Yahweh,</p>
<p class="q2">neither do they understand his counsel;</p>
<p class="q2">for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion;</p>
<p class="q2">for I will make your horn iron,</p>

<p class="q">and you will beat in pieces many peoples:</p>
<p class="q">and I will devote their gain to Yahweh,</p>
<p class="q2">and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p id="5" class="c">5</p>
<p class="q"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now you shall gather yourself in troops,</p>
<p class="q2">daughter of troops.</p>
<p class="q">He has laid siege against us.</p>
<p class="q2">They will strike the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,</p>
<p class="q2">being small among the clans of Judah,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who is in labor gives birth.</p>
<p class="q2">Then the rest of his brothers will return to the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>He shall stand, and shall shepherd in the strength of Yahweh,</p>
<p class="q2">in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God:</p>
<p class="q2">and they will live, for then he will be great to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>He will be our peace when Assyria invades our land,</p>
<p class="q2">and when he marches through our fortresses,</p>
<p class="q2">then we will raise against him seven shepherds,</p>
<p class="q2">and eight leaders of men.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>They will rule the land of Assyria with the sword,</p>
<p class="q2">and the land of Nimrod in its gates.</p>
<p class="q">He will deliver us from the Assyrian,</p>
<p class="q2">when he invades our land,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently.</p>
<p class="q2">The ruler and judge ask for a bribe;</p>
<p class="q2">and the powerful man dictates the evil desire of his soul.</p>
<p class="q2">Thus they conspire together.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>The best of them is like a brier.</p>
<p class="q2">The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge.</p>
<p class="q">The day of your watchmen,</p>
<p class="q2">even your visitation, has come;</p>
<p class="q2">now is the time of their confusion.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Don’t trust in a neighbor.</p>
<p class="q2">Don’t put confidence in a friend.</p>
<p class="q2">With the woman lying in your embrace,</p>
<p class="q2">be careful of the words of your mouth!</p>
<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>For the son dishonors the father,</p>
<p class="q2">the daughter rises up against her mother,</p>
<p class="q2">the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;</p>
<p class="q2">a man’s enemies are the men of his own house.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>But as for me, I will look to Yahweh.</p>
<p class="q2">I will wait for the God of my salvation.</p>
<p class="q2">My God will hear me.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Don’t rejoice against me, my enemy.</p>
<p class="q2">When I fall, I will arise.</p>
<p class="q2">When I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to me.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>I will bear the indignation of Yahweh,</p>
<p class="q2">because I have sinned against him,</p>
<p class="q2">until he pleads my case, and executes judgment for me.</p>
<p class="q2">He will bring me out to the light.</p>
<p class="q2">I will see his righteousness.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Then my enemy will see it,</p>
<p class="q2">and shame will cover her who said to me,</p>
<p class="q2">where is Yahweh your God?</p>
<p class="q">Then my enemy will see me and will cover her shame.</p>
<p class="q2">Now she will be trodden down like the mire of the streets.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>A day to build your walls—</p>
<p class="q2">In that day, he will extend your boundary.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,</p>
<p class="q2">and from Egypt even to the River,</p>
<p class="q2">and from sea to sea,</p>
<p class="q2">and mountain to mountain.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell therein,</p>
<p class="q2">for the fruit of their doings.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Shepherd your people with your staff,</p>
<p class="q2">the flock of your heritage,</p>
<p class="q2">who dwell by themselves in a forest,</p>
<p class="q2">in the middle of fertile pasture land, let them feed;</p>
<p class="q2">in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>“As in the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt,</p>
<p class="q2">I will show them marvelous things.”</p>
<p class="q"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might.</p>
<p class="q2">They will lay their hand on their mouth.</p>
<p class="q2">Their ears will be deaf.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>They will lick the dust like a serpent.</p>
<p class="q2">Like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their dens.</p>
<p class="q2">They will come with fear to Yahweh our God,</p>
<p class="q2">and will be afraid because of you.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Who is a God like you, who pardons iniquity,</p>
<p class="q2">and passes over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage?</p>
<p class="q">He doesn’t retain his anger forever,</p>
<p class="q2">because he delights in loving kindness.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>He will again have compassion on us.</p>
<p class="q2">He will tread our iniquities under foot;</p>
<p class="q2">and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>You will give truth to Jacob,</p>
<p class="q2">and mercy to Abraham,</p>
<p class="q2">as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.</p>
