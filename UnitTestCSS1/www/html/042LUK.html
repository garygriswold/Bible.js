<p class="mt2">The Good News According to</p>
<p class="mt">Luke</p>
<p id="1" class="c">1</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us, <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus; <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Now while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his division, <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>But the angel said to him, “Don’t be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>You will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord, their God. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,’<span class="x">+<span class="xo">1:17 </span><span class="xt">Malachi 4:6</span></span> and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people prepared for the Lord.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Zacharias said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Behold,<span class="f">+</span> you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because you didn’t believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled that he delayed in the temple. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>When the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>After these days Elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying, <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>“Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among men.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of David’s house. The virgin’s name was Mary. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Having come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>Behold, you will conceive in your womb, and give birth to a son, and will call his name ‘Jesus.’ <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David, <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>The angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the Son of God. <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>Behold, Elizabeth, your relative, also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>For nothing spoken by God is impossible.”<span class="f">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="38" class="v">38 </span>Mary said, “Behold, the servant of the Lord; let it be done to me according to your word.”</p>
<p class="p">The angel departed from her.
    <span id="39" class="v">39 </span>Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah, <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. <span id="42" class="v">42 </span>She called out with a loud voice, and said, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>Why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? <span id="44" class="v">44 </span>For behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy! <span id="45" class="v">45 </span>Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="46" class="v">46 </span>Mary said,</p>
<p class="q">“My soul magnifies the Lord.</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="47" class="v">47 </span>My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="48" class="v">48 </span>for he has looked at the humble state of his servant.</p>
<p class="q">For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="49" class="v">49 </span>For he who is mighty has done great things for me.</p>
<p class="q2">Holy is his name.</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="50" class="v">50 </span>His mercy is for generations of generations on those who fear him.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="51" class="v">51 </span>He has shown strength with his arm.</p>
<p class="q2">He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="52" class="v">52 </span>He has put down princes from their thrones.</p>
<p class="q2">And has exalted the lowly.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="53" class="v">53 </span>He has filled the hungry with good things.</p>
<p class="q2">He has sent the rich away empty.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="54" class="v">54 </span>He has given help to Israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy,</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="55" class="v">55 </span>As he spoke to our fathers,</p>
<p class="q2">to Abraham and his offspring<span class="f">+</span> forever.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="56" class="v">56 </span>Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to her house. <span id="57" class="v">57 </span>Now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was fulfilled, and she gave birth to a son. <span id="58" class="v">58 </span>Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and they rejoiced with her. <span id="59" class="v">59 </span>On the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of his father. <span id="60" class="v">60 </span>His mother answered, “Not so; but he will be called John.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="61" class="v">61 </span>They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.” <span id="62" class="v">62 </span>They made signs to his father, what he would have him called.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="63" class="v">63 </span>He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, “His name is John.”</p>
<p class="p">They all marveled.
    <span id="64" class="v">64 </span>His mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing God. <span id="65" class="v">65 </span>Fear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea. <span id="66" class="v">66 </span>All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, “What then will this child be?” The hand of the Lord was with him. <span id="67" class="v">67 </span>His father, Zacharias, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="68" class="v">68 </span>“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,</p>
<p class="q2">for he has visited and redeemed his people;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="69" class="v">69 </span>and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="70" class="v">70 </span>(as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old),</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="71" class="v">71 </span>salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="72" class="v">72 </span>to show mercy towards our fathers,</p>
<p class="q2">to remember his holy covenant,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="73" class="v">73 </span>the oath which he swore to Abraham, our father,</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="74" class="v">74 </span>to grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies,</p>
<p class="q2">should serve him without fear,</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="75" class="v">75 </span>In holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="76" class="v">76 </span>And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High,</p>
<p class="q2">for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="77" class="v">77 </span>to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="78" class="v">78 </span>because of the tender mercy of our God,</p>
<p class="q2">whereby the dawn from on high will visit us,</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="79" class="v">79 </span>to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death;</p>
<p class="q2">to guide our feet into the way of peace.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="80" class="v">80 </span>The child was growing, and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel.</p>
<p id="2" class="c">2</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David; <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>to enroll himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>While they were there, the day had come for her to give birth. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>The angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>For there is born to you today, in David’s city, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>This is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough.” <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God, and saying,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>“Glory to God in the highest,</p>
<p class="q2">on earth peace, good will toward men.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>When the angels went away from them into the sky, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>They came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>When they saw it, they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was told them.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>When eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child, his name was called Jesus, which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>When the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>(as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord”),<span class="x">+</span><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, “A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.”<span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.<span class="f">+</span><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>He came in the Spirit into the temple. When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do concerning him according to the custom of the law, <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>“Now you are releasing your servant, Master,</p>
<p class="q2">according to your word, in peace;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>for my eyes have seen your salvation,</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>a light for revelation to the nations,</p>
<p class="q2">and the glory of your people Israel.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>Joseph and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him, <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>and Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, his mother, “Behold, this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against. <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>Yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>There was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity, <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>and she had been a widow for about eighty-four years), who didn’t depart from the temple, worshiping with fastings and petitions night and day. <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>Coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="39" class="v">39 </span>When they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth. <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>The child was growing, and was becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him. <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>His parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="42" class="v">42 </span>When he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast, <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didn’t know it, <span id="44" class="v">44 </span>but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey, and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances. <span id="45" class="v">45 </span>When they didn’t find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him. <span id="46" class="v">46 </span>After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them questions. <span id="47" class="v">47 </span>All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. <span id="48" class="v">48 </span>When they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us this way? Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="49" class="v">49 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?”</span><span id="50" class="v">50 </span>They didn’t understand the saying which he spoke to them. <span id="51" class="v">51 </span>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. <span id="52" class="v">52 </span>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.</p>
<p id="3" class="c">3</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>He came into all the region around the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of sins. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,</p>
<p class="q">“The voice of one crying in the wilderness,</p>
<p class="q2">‘Make ready the way of the Lord.</p>
<p class="q">Make his paths straight.</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Every valley will be filled.</p>
<p class="q">Every mountain and hill will be brought low.</p>
<p class="q2">The crooked will become straight,</p>
<p class="q2">and the rough ways smooth.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>All flesh will see God’s salvation.’”<span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance, and don’t begin to say among yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father;’ for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones! <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Even now the ax also lies at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>The multitudes asked him, “What then must we do?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>He answered them, “He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. He who has food, let him do likewise.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, “Teacher, what must we do?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>He said to them, “Collect no more than that which is appointed to you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Soldiers also asked him, saying, “What about us? What must we do?”</p>
<p class="p">He said to them, “Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Christ, <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>John answered them all, “I indeed baptize you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire, <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Then with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people, <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>but Herod the tetrarch,<span class="f">+</span> being reproved by him for Herodias, his brother’s <span class="f">+</span> wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done, <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus also had been baptized, and was praying. The sky was opened, <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form like a dove on him; and a voice came out of the sky, saying “You are my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Jesus himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years old, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli, <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Joseph, the son of Judah, <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmodam, the son of Er, <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>the son of Jose, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonan, the son of Eliakim, <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>the son of Melea, the son of Menan, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon, <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>the son of Amminadab, the son of Aram,<span class="f">+</span> the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah, <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan, <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.</p>

<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>for forty days, being tempted by the devil. He ate nothing in those days. Afterward, when they were completed, he was hungry. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Jesus answered him, saying, <span class="wj">“It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.’”</span><span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>The devil, leading him up on a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>The devil said to him, “I will give you all this authority, and their glory, for it has been delivered to me; and I give it to whomever I want. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Jesus answered him, <span class="wj">“Get behind me Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.’”</span><span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>He led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here, <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>for it is written,</p>
<p class="q">‘He will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you;’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>and,</p>
<p class="q">‘On their hands they will bear you up,</p>
<p class="q2">lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone.’”<span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Jesus answering, said to him, <span class="wj">“It has been said, ‘You shall not tempt the Lord your God.’”</span><span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>When the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him until another time.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and news about him spread through all the surrounding area. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. He entered, as was his custom, into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>The book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. He opened the book, and found the place where it was written,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span><span class="wj">“The Spirit of the Lord is on me,</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.</span></p>
<p class="q"><span class="wj">He has sent me to heal the broken hearted,</span><span class="f">+</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">to proclaim release to the captives,</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">recovering of sight to the blind,</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">to deliver those who are crushed,</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span><span class="wj">and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.”</span><span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>He began to tell them, <span class="wj">“Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>All testified about him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth, and they said, “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Doubtless you will tell me this parable, ‘Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in your hometown.’”</span><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>He said, <span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown. </span><span id="25" class="v">25 </span><span class="wj">But truly I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land. </span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span><span class="wj">Elijah was sent to none of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. </span><span id="27" class="v">27 </span><span class="wj">There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed, except Naaman, the Syrian.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>They were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>They rose up, threw him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that they might throw him off the cliff. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>But he, passing through the middle of them, went his way.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. He was teaching them on the Sabbath day, <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>In the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>saying, “Ah! what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>Jesus rebuked him, saying, <span class="wj">“Be silent, and come out of him!” </span>  When the demon had thrown him down in the middle of them, he came out of him, having done him no harm.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>Amazement came on all, and they spoke together, one with another, saying, “What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!” <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>News about him went out into every place of the surrounding region.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="38" class="v">38 </span>He rose up from the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s house. Simon’s mother-in-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him for her. <span id="39" class="v">39 </span>He stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them. <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>When the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>Demons also came out of many, crying out, and saying, “You are the Christ, the Son of God!” Rebuking them, he didn’t allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="42" class="v">42 </span>When it was day, he departed and went into an uninhabited place, and the multitudes looked for him, and came to him, and held on to him, so that he wouldn’t go away from them. <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>But he said to them, <span class="wj">“I must preach the good news of God’s Kingdom to the other cities also. For this reason I have been sent.”</span><span id="44" class="v">44 </span>He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.</p>
<p id="5" class="c">5</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, <span class="wj">“Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Simon answered him, “Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the net.” <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.” <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught; <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.</p>
<p class="p">Jesus said to Simon, <span class="wj">“Don’t be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>While he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>He stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, <span class="wj">“I want to. Be made clean.”</span></p>
<p class="p">Immediately the leprosy left him.
    <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>He commanded him to tell no one, <span class="wj">“But go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”</span><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>But the report concerning him spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>But he withdrew himself into the desert, and prayed.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>On one of those days, he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal them. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the middle before Jesus. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Seeing their faith, he said to him, <span class="wj">“Man, your sins are forgiven you.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, <span class="wj">“Why are you reasoning so in your hearts? </span><span id="23" class="v">23 </span><span class="wj">Which is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you;’ or to say, ‘Arise and walk?’ </span><span id="24" class="v">24 </span><span class="wj">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”</span> (he said to the paralyzed man), <span class="wj">“I tell you, arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen strange things today.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>After these things he went out, and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and said to him, <span class="wj">“Follow me!”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>He left everything, and rose up and followed him. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Levi made a great feast for him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?” <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>Jesus answered them, <span class="wj">“Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do. </span><span id="32" class="v">32 </span><span class="wj">I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>They said to him, “Why do John’s disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them? </span><span id="35" class="v">35 </span><span class="wj">But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those days.”</span><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>He also told a parable to them. <span class="wj">“No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old. </span><span id="37" class="v">37 </span><span class="wj">No one puts new wine into old wine skins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed. </span><span id="38" class="v">38 </span><span class="wj">But new wine must be put into fresh wine skins, and both are preserved. </span><span id="39" class="v">39 </span><span class="wj">No man having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says, ‘The old is better.’”</span></p>
<p id="6" class="c">6</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now on the second Sabbath after the first, he was going through the grain fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate, rubbing them in their hands. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>But some of the Pharisees said to them, “Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Jesus, answering them, said, <span class="wj">“Haven’t you read what David did when he was hungry, he, and those who were with him; </span><span id="4" class="v">4 </span><span class="wj">how he entered into God’s house, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?”</span><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>It also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his right hand was withered. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>The scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand, <span class="wj">“Rise up, and stand in the middle.”</span> He arose and stood. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?”</span><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>He looked around at them all, and said to the man, <span class="wj">“Stretch out your hand.”</span> He did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>In these days, he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles: <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew; <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Simon, who was called the Zealot; <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Judas the son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>He came down with them, and stood on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and they were being healed. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>All the multitude sought to touch him, for power came out of him and healed them all.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>He lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said,</p>
<p class="q"><span class="wj">“Blessed are you who are poor,</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">God’s Kingdom is yours.</span></p>
<p class="q"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span><span class="wj">Blessed are you who hunger now,</span></p>

<p class="q2"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span><span class="wj">Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets.</span></p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span><span class="wj">“But woe to you who are rich!</span></p>

<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span><span class="wj">“But I tell you who hear: love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, </span><span id="28" class="v">28 </span><span class="wj">bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you. </span><span id="29" class="v">29 </span><span class="wj">To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, don’t withhold your coat also. </span><span id="30" class="v">30 </span><span class="wj">Give to everyone who asks you, and don’t ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again.</span></p>

<p class="p"><span id="39" class="v">39 </span>He spoke a parable to them. <span class="wj">“Can the blind guide the blind?

<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>A certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>When they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for you to do this for him, <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us.” <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Jesus went with them. When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Therefore I didn’t even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, <span class="wj">“I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.”</span><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Soon afterwards, he went to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples, along with a great multitude, went with him. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, <span class="wj">“Don’t cry.”</span><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>He came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, <span class="wj">“Young man, I tell you, arise!”</span><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>He who was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Fear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has arisen among us!” and, “God has visited his people!” <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea, and in all the surrounding region.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>The disciples of John told him about all these things. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>John, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, “Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another?” <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>When the men had come to him, they said, “John the Baptizer has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Jesus answered them, <span class="wj">“Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. </span><span id="23" class="v">23 </span><span class="wj">Blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>When John’s messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John, <span class="wj">“What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? </span><span id="25" class="v">25 </span><span class="wj">But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts. </span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span><span class="wj">But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet. </span><span id="27" class="v">27 </span><span class="wj">This is he of whom it is written,</span></p>
<p class="q"><span class="wj">‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face,</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">who will prepare your way before you.’</span><span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span><span class="wj">“For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer, yet he who is least in God’s Kingdom is greater than he.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having been baptized with John’s baptism. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span><span class="f">+</span><span class="wj">“To what then will I liken the people of this generation? What are they like? </span><span id="32" class="v">32 </span><span class="wj">They are like children who sit in the marketplace, and call to one another, saying, ‘We piped to you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned, and you didn’t weep.’ </span><span id="33" class="v">33 </span><span class="wj">For John the Baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’ </span><span id="34" class="v">34 </span><span class="wj">The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man, and a drunkard; a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ </span><span id="35" class="v">35 </span><span class="wj">Wisdom is justified by all her children.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>One of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisee’s house, and sat at the table. <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>Behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster jar of ointment. <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>Standing behind at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. <span id="39" class="v">39 </span>Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, “This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him, that she is a sinner.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="40" class="v">40 </span>Jesus answered him, <span class="wj">“Simon, I have something to tell you.” </span></p>
<p class="p">He said, “Teacher, say on.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="41" class="v">41 </span><span class="wj">“A certain lender had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. </span><span id="42" class="v">42 </span><span class="wj">When they couldn’t pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="43" class="v">43 </span>Simon answered, “He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most.”</p>
<p class="p">He said to him, <span class="wj">“You have judged correctly.”</span><span id="44" class="v">44 </span>Turning to the woman, he said to Simon, <span class="wj">“Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head. </span><span id="45" class="v">45 </span><span class="wj">You gave me no kiss, but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet. </span><span id="46" class="v">46 </span><span class="wj">You didn’t anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. </span><span id="47" class="v">47 </span><span class="wj">Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.” </span><span id="48" class="v">48 </span>He said to her, <span class="wj">“Your sins are forgiven.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="49" class="v">49 </span>Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="50" class="v">50 </span>He said to the woman, <span class="wj">“Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.” </span></p>
<p id="8" class="c">8</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Soon afterwards, he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good news of God’s Kingdom. With him were the twelve, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out; <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod’s steward; Susanna; and many others; who served them<span class="f">+</span> from their possessions. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>When a great multitude came together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span><span class="wj">“The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it. </span><span id="6" class="v">6 </span><span class="wj">Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture. </span><span id="7" class="v">7 </span><span class="wj">Other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it. </span><span id="8" class="v">8 </span><span class="wj">Other fell into the good ground, and grew, and produced one hundred times as much fruit.”</span> As he said these things, he called out, <span class="wj">“He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Then his disciples asked him, “What does this parable mean?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>He said, <span class="wj">“To you it is given to know the mysteries of God’s Kingdom, but to the rest in parables; that ‘seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.’</span><span class="x">+</span><span id="11" class="v">11 </span><span class="wj">Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. </span><span id="12" class="v">12 </span><span class="wj">Those along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved. </span><span id="13" class="v">13 </span><span class="wj">Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation. </span><span id="14" class="v">14 </span><span class="wj">That which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity. </span><span id="15" class="v">15 </span><span class="wj">Those in the good ground, these are those who with an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and produce fruit with perseverance.</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span><span class="wj">“No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in may see the light. </span><span id="17" class="v">17 </span><span class="wj">For nothing is hidden, that will not be revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to light. </span><span id="18" class="v">18 </span><span class="wj">Be careful therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever doesn’t have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>His mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Some people told him, “Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>But he answered them, <span class="wj">“My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God, and do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Now on one of those days, he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, <span class="wj">“Let’s go over to the other side of the lake.”</span> So they launched out. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>They came to him, and awoke him, saying, “Master, master, we are dying!” He awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm.<span class="x">+</span><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Where is your faith?”</span> Being afraid they marveled, saying to one another, “Who is this then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?” <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>They arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and didn’t live in a house, but in the tombs. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, “What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torment me!” <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bonds apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Jesus asked him, <span class="wj">“What is your name?”</span></p>
<p class="p">He said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him.
    <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>They begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. He allowed them. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>The demons came out of the man, and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>People went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed. <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned. <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, <span id="39" class="v">39 </span><span class="wj">“Return to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you.”</span> He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="40" class="v">40 </span>When Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him. <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>Behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus’ feet, and begged him to come into his house, <span id="42" class="v">42 </span>for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him. <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any, <span id="44" class="v">44 </span>came behind him, and touched the fringe<span class="f">+</span> of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped. <span id="45" class="v">45 </span>Jesus said, <span class="wj">“Who touched me?”</span></p>
<p class="p">When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, <span class="wj">‘Who touched me?’</span>”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="46" class="v">46 </span>But Jesus said, <span class="wj">“Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me.”</span><span id="47" class="v">47 </span>When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately. <span id="48" class="v">48 </span>He said to her, <span class="wj">“Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="49" class="v">49 </span>While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house came, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t trouble the Teacher.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="50" class="v">50 </span>But Jesus hearing it, answered him, <span class="wj">“Don’t be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="51" class="v">51 </span>When he came to the house, he didn’t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, and her mother. <span id="52" class="v">52 </span>All were weeping and mourning her, but he said, <span class="wj">“Don’t weep. She isn’t dead, but sleeping.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="53" class="v">53 </span>They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead. <span id="54" class="v">54 </span>But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying, <span class="wj">“Child, arise!”</span><span id="55" class="v">55 </span>Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat. <span id="56" class="v">56 </span>Her parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done.</p>
<p id="9" class="c">9</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>He called the twelve<span class="f">+</span> together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>He sent them out to preach God’s Kingdom and to heal the sick. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Take nothing for your journey—neither staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats each. </span><span id="4" class="v">4 </span><span class="wj">Into whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there. </span><span id="5" class="v">5 </span><span class="wj">As many as don’t receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>They departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the Good News, and healing everywhere. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead, <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Herod said, “John I beheaded, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?” He sought to see him. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>The apostles, when they had returned, told him what things they had done.</p>
<p class="p">He took them, and withdrew apart to a desert region of<span class="f">+</span> a city called Bethsaida.
    <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>But the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to them of God’s Kingdom, and he cured those who needed healing. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>The day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, “Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we are here in a deserted place.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>But he said to them, <span class="wj">“You give them something to eat.”</span></p>
<p class="p">They said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people.”
    <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>For they were about five thousand men.</p>
<p class="p">He said to his disciples, <span class="wj">“Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”</span><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>They did so, and made them all sit down. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>They ate, and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>As he was praying alone, the disciples were with him, and he asked them, <span class="wj">“Who do the multitudes say that I am?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>They answered, “‘John the Baptizer,’ but others say, ‘Elijah,’ and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“But who do you say that I am?”</span></p>
<p class="p">Peter answered, “The Christ of God.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>But he warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no one, <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>saying, <span class="wj">“The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>He said to all, <span class="wj">“If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross,</span><span class="f">+</span><span class="wj">and follow me. </span><span id="24" class="v">24 </span><span class="wj">For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same will save it. </span><span id="25" class="v">25 </span><span class="wj">For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self? </span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span><span class="wj">For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels. </span><span id="27" class="v">27 </span><span class="wj">But I tell you the truth: There are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death, until they see God’s Kingdom.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>About eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to pray. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah, <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure,<span class="f">+</span> which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>As they were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he said.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud. <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>A voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!” <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>When the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him. <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>Behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child. <span id="39" class="v">39 </span>Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely. <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>I begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn’t.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="41" class="v">41 </span>Jesus answered, <span class="wj">“Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="42" class="v">42 </span>While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>They were all astonished at the majesty of God.</p>
<p class="p">But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,
    <span id="44" class="v">44 </span><span class="wj">“Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men.”</span><span id="45" class="v">45 </span>But they didn’t understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="46" class="v">46 </span>There arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest. <span id="47" class="v">47 </span>Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side, <span id="48" class="v">48 </span>and said to them, <span class="wj">“Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="49" class="v">49 </span>John answered, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn’t follow with us.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="50" class="v">50 </span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Don’t forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="51" class="v">51 </span>It came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem, <span id="52" class="v">52 </span>and sent messengers before his face. They went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him. <span id="53" class="v">53 </span>They didn’t receive him, because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem. <span id="54" class="v">54 </span>When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah did?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="55" class="v">55 </span>But he turned and rebuked them, <span class="wj">“You don’t know of what kind of spirit you are. </span><span id="56" class="v">56 </span><span class="wj">For the Son of Man didn’t come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.”</span></p>
<p class="p">They went to another village.
    <span id="57" class="v">57 </span>As they went on the way, a certain man said to him, “I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="58" class="v">58 </span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="59" class="v">59 </span>He said to another, <span class="wj">“Follow me!”</span></p>
<p class="p">But he said, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="60" class="v">60 </span>But Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce God’s Kingdom.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="61" class="v">61 </span>Another also said, “I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say good-bye to those who are at my house.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="62" class="v">62 </span>But Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for God’s Kingdom.”</span></p>
<p id="10" class="c">10</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now after these things, the Lord also appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two ahead of him<span class="f">+</span> into every city and place, where he was about to come. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Then he said to them, <span class="wj">“The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he may send out laborers into his harvest. </span><span id="3" class="v">3 </span><span class="wj">Go your ways. Behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves. </span><span id="4" class="v">4 </span><span class="wj">Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor sandals. Greet no one on the way. </span><span id="5" class="v">5 </span><span class="wj">Into whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace be to this house.’ </span><span id="6" class="v">6 </span><span class="wj">If a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you. </span><span id="7" class="v">7 </span><span class="wj">Remain in that same house, eating and drinking the things they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Don’t go from house to house. </span><span id="8" class="v">8 </span><span class="wj">Into whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat the things that are set before you. </span><span id="9" class="v">9 </span><span class="wj">Heal the sick who are therein, and tell them, ‘God’s Kingdom has come near to you.’ </span><span id="10" class="v">10 </span><span class="wj">But into whatever city you enter, and they don’t receive you, go out into its streets and say, </span><span id="11" class="v">11 </span><span class="wj">‘Even the dust from your city that clings to us, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that God’s Kingdom has come near to you.’ </span><span id="12" class="v">12 </span><span class="wj">I tell you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span><span class="wj">“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. </span><span id="14" class="v">14 </span><span class="wj">But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you. </span><span id="15" class="v">15 </span><span class="wj">You, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades. </span><span class="f">+</span><span id="16" class="v">16 </span><span class="wj">Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me. Whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>The seventy returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“I saw Satan having fallen like lightning from heaven. </span><span id="19" class="v">19 </span><span class="wj">Behold, I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will in any way hurt you. </span><span id="20" class="v">20 </span><span class="wj">Nevertheless, don’t rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, <span class="wj">“I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Turning to the disciples, he said, <span class="wj">“All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son desires to reveal him.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Turning to the disciples, he said privately, <span class="wj">“Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see, </span><span id="24" class="v">24 </span><span class="wj">for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and didn’t see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and didn’t hear them.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>He said to him, <span class="wj">“What is written in the law? How do you read it?” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>He answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind;<span class="x">+</span> and your neighbor as yourself.”<span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>He said to him, <span class="wj">“You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>But he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, “Who is my neighbor?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Jesus answered, <span class="wj">“A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. </span><span id="31" class="v">31 </span><span class="wj">By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side. </span><span id="32" class="v">32 </span><span class="wj">In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. </span><span id="33" class="v">33 </span><span class="wj">But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, </span><span id="34" class="v">34 </span><span class="wj">came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. </span><span id="35" class="v">35 </span><span class="wj">On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to him, ‘Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.’ </span><span id="36" class="v">36 </span><span class="wj">Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>He said, “He who showed mercy on him.”</p>
<p class="p">Then Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Go and do likewise.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="38" class="v">38 </span>As they went on their way, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. <span id="39" class="v">39 </span>She had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus’ feet, and heard his word. <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she came up to him, and said, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister left me to serve alone? Ask her therefore to help me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="41" class="v">41 </span>Jesus answered her, <span class="wj">“Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things, </span><span id="42" class="v">42 </span><span class="wj">but one thing is needed. Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her.”</span></p>
<p id="11" class="c">11</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>When he finished praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“When you pray, say,</span></p>
<p class="q"><span class="wj">‘Our Father in heaven,</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">may your name be kept holy.</span></p>
<p class="q"><span class="wj">May your Kingdom come.</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">May your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.</span></p>
<p class="q"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span><span class="wj">Give us day by day our daily bread.</span></p>
<p class="q"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span><span class="wj">Forgive us our sins,</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. </span></p>
<p class="q"><span class="wj">Bring us not into temptation,</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">but deliver us from the evil one.’”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Which of you, if you go to a friend at midnight, and tell him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, </span><span id="6" class="v">6 </span><span class="wj">for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him,’ </span><span id="7" class="v">7 </span><span class="wj">and he from within will answer and say, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I can’t get up and give it to you’? </span><span id="8" class="v">8 </span><span class="wj">I tell you, although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs.</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span><span class="wj">“I tell you, keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and it will be opened to you. </span><span id="10" class="v">10 </span><span class="wj">For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span><span class="wj">“Which of you fathers, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he won’t give him a snake instead of a fish, will he? </span><span id="12" class="v">12 </span><span class="wj">Or if he asks for an egg, he won’t give him a scorpion, will he? </span><span id="13" class="v">13 </span><span class="wj">If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. When the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>But some of them said, “He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.” <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Others, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, <span class="wj">“Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls. </span><span id="18" class="v">18 </span><span class="wj">If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul. </span><span id="19" class="v">19 </span><span class="wj">But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore will they be your judges. </span><span id="20" class="v">20 </span><span class="wj">But if I by God’s finger cast out demons, then God’s Kingdom has come to you.</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span><span class="wj">“When the strong man, fully armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe. </span><span id="22" class="v">22 </span><span class="wj">But when someone stronger attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted, and divides his plunder. </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span><span class="wj">“He that is not with me is against me. He who doesn’t gather with me scatters. </span><span id="24" class="v">24 </span><span class="wj">The unclean spirit, when he has gone out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding none, he says, ‘I will turn back to my house from which I came out.’ </span><span id="25" class="v">25 </span><span class="wj">When he returns, he finds it swept and put in order. </span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span><span class="wj">Then he goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>It came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said to him, “Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>But he said, <span class="wj">“On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God, and keep it.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>When the multitudes were gathering together to him, he began to say, <span class="wj">“This is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah, the prophet. </span><span id="30" class="v">30 </span><span class="wj">For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation. </span><span id="31" class="v">31 </span><span class="wj">The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here. </span><span id="32" class="v">32 </span><span class="wj">The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, one greater than Jonah is here.</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span><span class="wj">“No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the light. </span><span id="34" class="v">34 </span><span class="wj">The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness. </span><span id="35" class="v">35 </span><span class="wj">Therefore see whether the light that is in you isn’t darkness. </span><span id="36" class="v">36 </span><span class="wj">If therefore your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>Now as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him. He went in, and sat at the table. <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>When the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner. <span id="39" class="v">39 </span>The Lord said to him, <span class="wj">“Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness. </span><span id="40" class="v">40 </span><span class="wj">You foolish ones, didn’t he who made the outside make the inside also? </span><span id="41" class="v">41 </span><span class="wj">But give for gifts to the needy those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to you. </span><span id="42" class="v">42 </span><span class="wj">But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass justice and God’s love. You ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone. </span><span id="43" class="v">43 </span><span class="wj">Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces. </span><span id="44" class="v">44 </span><span class="wj">Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves, and the men who walk over them don’t know it.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="45" class="v">45 </span>One of the lawyers answered him, “Teacher, in saying this you insult us also.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="46" class="v">46 </span>He said, <span class="wj">“Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves won’t even lift one finger to help carry those burdens. </span><span id="47" class="v">47 </span><span class="wj">Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. </span><span id="48" class="v">48 </span><span class="wj">So you testify and consent to the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their tombs. </span><span id="49" class="v">49 </span><span class="wj">Therefore also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute, </span><span id="50" class="v">50 </span><span class="wj">that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation; </span><span id="51" class="v">51 </span><span class="wj">from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.’ Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation. </span><span id="52" class="v">52 </span><span class="wj">Woe to you lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge. You didn’t enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="53" class="v">53 </span>As he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things out of him; <span id="54" class="v">54 </span>lying in wait for him, and seeking to catch him in something he might say, that they might accuse him.</p>
<p id="12" class="c">12</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Meanwhile, when a multitude of many thousands had gathered together, so much so that they trampled on each other, he began to tell his disciples first of all, <span class="wj">“Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. </span><span id="2" class="v">2 </span><span class="wj">But there is nothing covered up, that will not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known. </span><span id="3" class="v">3 </span><span class="wj">Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. What you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span><span class="wj">“I tell you, my friends, don’t be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. </span><span id="5" class="v">5 </span><span class="wj">But I will warn you whom you should fear. Fear him, who after he has killed, has power to cast into Gehenna.</span><span class="f">+</span><span class="wj">Yes, I tell you, fear him.</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span><span class="wj">“Aren’t five sparrows sold for two assaria coins</span><span class="f">+</span><span class="wj">? Not one of them is forgotten by God. </span><span id="7" class="v">7 </span><span class="wj">But the very hairs of your head are all counted. Therefore don’t be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span><span class="wj">“I tell you, everyone who confesses me before men, him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God; </span><span id="9" class="v">9 </span><span class="wj">but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God. </span><span id="10" class="v">10 </span><span class="wj">Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. </span><span id="11" class="v">11 </span><span class="wj">When they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, don’t be anxious how or what you will answer, or what you will say; </span><span id="12" class="v">12 </span><span class="wj">for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what you must say.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>One of the multitude said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>But he said to him, <span class="wj">“Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?”</span><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Beware! Keep yourselves from covetousness, for a man’s life doesn’t consist of the abundance of the things which he possesses.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>He spoke a parable to them, saying, <span class="wj">“The ground of a certain rich man produced abundantly. </span><span id="17" class="v">17 </span><span class="wj">He reasoned within himself, saying, ‘What will I do, because I don’t have room to store my crops?’ </span><span id="18" class="v">18 </span><span class="wj">He said, ‘This is what I will do. I will pull down my barns, and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. </span><span id="19" class="v">19 </span><span class="wj">I will tell my soul, “Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, be merry.”’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span><span class="wj">“But God said to him, ‘You foolish one, tonight your soul is required of you. The things which you have prepared—whose will they be?’ </span><span id="21" class="v">21 </span><span class="wj">So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>He said to his disciples, <span class="wj">“Therefore I tell you, don’t be anxious for your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what you will wear. </span><span id="23" class="v">23 </span><span class="wj">Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing. </span><span id="24" class="v">24 </span><span class="wj">Consider the ravens: they don’t sow, they don’t reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds! </span><span id="25" class="v">25 </span><span class="wj">Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit<span class="f">+</span> to his height? </span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span><span class="wj">If then you aren’t able to do even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest? </span><span id="27" class="v">27 </span><span class="wj">Consider the lilies, how they grow. They don’t toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. </span><span id="28" class="v">28 </span><span class="wj">But if this is how God clothes the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith? </span><span id="29" class="v">29 </span><span class="wj">Don’t seek what you will eat or what you will drink; neither be anxious. </span><span id="30" class="v">30 </span><span class="wj">For the nations of the world seek after all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these things. </span><span id="31" class="v">31 </span><span class="wj">But seek God’s Kingdom, and all these things will be added to you. </span><span id="32" class="v">32 </span><span class="wj">Don’t be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the Kingdom. </span><span id="33" class="v">33 </span><span class="wj">Sell that which you have, and give gifts to the needy.

<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>He spoke this parable. <span class="wj">“A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none. </span><span id="7" class="v">7 </span><span class="wj">He said to the vine dresser, ‘Behold, these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and found none.

<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent over, and could in no way straighten herself up. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>When Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, <span class="wj">“Woman, you are freed from your infirmity.”</span><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>He laid his hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight, and glorified God.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>The ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the multitude, “There are six days in which men ought to work. Therefore come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Therefore the Lord answered him, <span class="wj">“You hypocrites!

<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>As he said these things, all his adversaries were disappointed, and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>He said, <span class="wj">“What is God’s Kingdom like?

<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Again he said, <span class="wj">“To what shall I compare God’s Kingdom? </span><span id="21" class="v">21 </span><span class="wj">It is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures </span><span class="f">+</span><span class="wj">of flour, until it was all leavened.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>He went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and traveling on to Jerusalem. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>One said to him, “Lord, are they few who are saved?”</p>
<p class="p">He said to them,

<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>On that same day, some Pharisees came, saying to him, “Get out of here, and go away, for Herod wants to kill you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Go and tell that fox, ‘Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I complete my mission. </span><span id="33" class="v">33 </span><span class="wj">Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it can’t be that a prophet would perish outside of Jerusalem.’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span><span class="wj">“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her!

<p id="14" class="c">14</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>When he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, they were watching him. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Behold, a certain man who had dropsy was in front of him. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, <span class="wj">“Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>But they were silent.</p>
<p class="p">He took him, and healed him, and let him go.
    <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>He answered them, <span class="wj">“Which of you, if your son</span><span class="f">+</span><span class="wj">or an ox fell into a well, wouldn’t immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>They couldn’t answer him regarding these things.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>He spoke a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the best seats, and said to them, <span id="8" class="v">8 </span><span class="wj">“When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, don’t sit in the best seat, since perhaps someone more honorable than you might be invited by him, </span><span id="9" class="v">9 </span><span class="wj">and he who invited both of you would come and tell you, ‘Make room for this person.’ Then you would begin, with shame, to take the lowest place. </span><span id="10" class="v">10 </span><span class="wj">But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes, he may tell you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you. </span><span id="11" class="v">11 </span><span class="wj">For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>He also said to the one who had invited him, <span class="wj">“When you make a dinner or a supper, don’t call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors, or perhaps they might also return the favor, and pay you back. </span><span id="13" class="v">13 </span><span class="wj">But when you make a feast, ask the poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind; </span><span id="14" class="v">14 </span><span class="wj">and you will be blessed, because they don’t have the resources to repay you. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>When one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things, he said to him, “Blessed is he who will feast in God’s Kingdom!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>But he said to him, <span class="wj">“A certain man made a great supper, and he invited many people. </span><span id="17" class="v">17 </span><span class="wj">He sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited, ‘Come, for everything is ready now.’ </span><span id="18" class="v">18 </span><span class="wj">They all as one began to make excuses.</span></p>
<p class="p"><span class="wj">“The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused.’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span><span class="wj">“Another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go try them out. Please have me excused.’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span><span class="wj">“Another said, ‘I have married a wife, and therefore I can’t come.’ </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span><span class="wj">“That servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame.’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span><span class="wj">“The servant said, ‘Lord, it is done as you commanded, and there is still room.’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span><span class="wj">“The lord said to the servant, ‘Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled. </span><span id="24" class="v">24 </span><span class="wj">For I tell you that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper.’”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Now great multitudes were going with him. He turned and said to them, <span id="26" class="v">26 </span><span class="wj">“If anyone comes to me, and doesn’t disregard</span><span class="f">+</span><span class="wj">his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he can’t be my disciple. </span><span id="27" class="v">27 </span><span class="wj">Whoever doesn’t bear his own cross, and come after me, can’t be my disciple. </span><span id="28" class="v">28 </span><span class="wj">For which of you, desiring to build a tower, doesn’t first sit down and count the cost, to see if he has enough to complete it? </span><span id="29" class="v">29 </span><span class="wj">Or perhaps, when he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock him, </span><span id="30" class="v">30 </span><span class="wj">saying, ‘This man began to build, and wasn’t able to finish.’ </span><span id="31" class="v">31 </span><span class="wj">Or what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? </span><span id="32" class="v">32 </span><span class="wj">Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an envoy, and asks for conditions of peace. </span><span id="33" class="v">33 </span><span class="wj">So therefore whoever of you who doesn’t renounce all that he has, he can’t be my disciple. </span><span id="34" class="v">34 </span><span class="wj">Salt is good, but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it? </span><span id="35" class="v">35 </span><span class="wj">It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile.

<p id="15" class="c">15</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming close to him to hear him. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>The Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, “This man welcomes sinners, and eats with them.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>He told them this parable. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span><span class="wj">“Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one of them, wouldn’t leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one that was lost, until he found it? </span><span id="5" class="v">5 </span><span class="wj">When he has found it, he carries it on his shoulders, rejoicing. </span><span id="6" class="v">6 </span><span class="wj">When he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!’ </span><span id="7" class="v">7 </span><span class="wj">I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance. </span><span id="8" class="v">8 </span><span class="wj">Or what woman, if she had ten drachma</span><span class="f">+</span><span class="wj">coins, if she lost one drachma coin, wouldn’t light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she found it? </span><span id="9" class="v">9 </span><span class="wj">When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost.’ </span><span id="10" class="v">10 </span><span class="wj">Even so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>He said, <span class="wj">“A certain man had two sons. </span><span id="12" class="v">12 </span><span class="wj">The younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of your property.’ He divided his livelihood between them. </span><span id="13" class="v">13 </span><span class="wj">Not many days after, the younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country. There he wasted his property with riotous living. </span><span id="14" class="v">14 </span><span class="wj">When he had spent all of it, there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in need. </span><span id="15" class="v">15 </span><span class="wj">He went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs. </span><span id="16" class="v">16 </span><span class="wj">He wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave him any. </span><span id="17" class="v">17 </span><span class="wj">But when he came to himself he said, ‘How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough to spare, and I’m dying with hunger! </span><span id="18" class="v">18 </span><span class="wj">I will get up and go to my father, and will tell him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight. </span><span id="19" class="v">19 </span><span class="wj">I am no more worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants.”’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span><span class="wj">“He arose, and came to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. </span><span id="21" class="v">21 </span><span class="wj">The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span><span class="wj">“But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring out the best robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet. </span><span id="23" class="v">23 </span><span class="wj">Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat, and celebrate; </span><span id="24" class="v">24 </span><span class="wj">for this, my son, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.’ They began to celebrate.</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span><span class="wj">“Now his elder son was in the field. As he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing. </span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span><span class="wj">He called one of the servants to him, and asked what was going on. </span><span id="27" class="v">27 </span><span class="wj">He said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and healthy.’ </span><span id="28" class="v">28 </span><span class="wj">But he was angry, and would not go in. Therefore his father came out, and begged him. </span><span id="29" class="v">29 </span><span class="wj">But he answered his father, ‘Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a commandment of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate with my friends. </span><span id="30" class="v">30 </span><span class="wj">But when this your son came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span><span class="wj">“He said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. </span><span id="32" class="v">32 </span><span class="wj">But it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.’”</span></p>
<p id="16" class="c">16</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>He also said to his disciples, <span class="wj">“There was a certain rich man who had a manager. An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions. </span><span id="2" class="v">2 </span><span class="wj">He called him, and said to him, ‘What is this that I hear about you?

<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span><span class="wj">“The manager said within himself, ‘What will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the management position from me?

<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span><span class="wj">“His lord commended the dishonest manager because he had done wisely, for the children of this world are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of the light. </span><span id="9" class="v">9 </span><span class="wj">I tell you, make for yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when you fail, they may receive you into the eternal tents. </span><span id="10" class="v">10 </span><span class="wj">He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much.

<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at him. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts.

From that time the Good News of God’s Kingdom is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it. </span><span id="17" class="v">17 </span><span class="wj">But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall. </span><span id="18" class="v">18 </span><span class="wj">Everyone who divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery. He who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery. </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span><span class="wj">“Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in luxury every day. </span><span id="20" class="v">20 </span><span class="wj">A certain beggar, named Lazarus, was taken to his gate, full of sores, </span><span id="21" class="v">21 </span><span class="wj">and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table. Yes, even the dogs came and licked his sores. </span><span id="22" class="v">22 </span><span class="wj">The beggar died, and he was carried away by the angels to Abraham’s bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried. </span><span id="23" class="v">23 </span><span class="wj">In Hades,<span class="f">+</span> he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far off, and Lazarus at his bosom. </span><span id="24" class="v">24 </span><span class="wj">He cried and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue! For I am in anguish in this flame.’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span><span class="wj">“But Abraham said, ‘Son, remember that you, in your lifetime, received your good things, and Lazarus, in the same way, bad things. But here he is now comforted, and you are in anguish. </span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span><span class="wj">Besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that those who want to pass from here to you are not able, and that no one may cross over from there to us.’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span><span class="wj">“He said, ‘I ask you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father’s house; </span><span id="28" class="v">28 </span><span class="wj">for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, so they won’t also come into this place of torment.’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span><span class="wj">“But Abraham said to him, ‘They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span><span class="wj">“He said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span><span class="wj">“He said to him, ‘If they don’t listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead.’”</span></p>
<p id="17" class="c">17</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>He said to the disciples, <span class="wj">“It is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come, but woe to him through whom they come! </span><span id="2" class="v">2 </span><span class="wj">It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble. </span><span id="3" class="v">3 </span><span class="wj">Be careful. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him. </span><span id="4" class="v">4 </span><span class="wj">If he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, ‘I repent,’ you shall forgive him.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>The Lord said, <span class="wj">“If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, ‘Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you. </span><span id="7" class="v">7 </span><span class="wj">But who is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say, when he comes in from the field, ‘Come immediately and sit down at the table,’ </span><span id="8" class="v">8 </span><span class="wj">and will not rather tell him, ‘Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me, while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink’? </span><span id="9" class="v">9 </span><span class="wj">Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded? I think not. </span><span id="10" class="v">10 </span><span class="wj">Even so you also, when you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, ‘We are unworthy servants. We have done our duty.’” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>As he was on his way to Jerusalem, he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>As he entered into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him, who stood at a distance. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>They lifted up their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>When he saw them, he said to them, <span class="wj">“Go and show yourselves to the priests.”</span> As they went, they were cleansed. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>He fell on his face at Jesus’ feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Jesus answered, <span class="wj">“Weren’t the ten cleansed? But where are the nine? </span><span id="18" class="v">18 </span><span class="wj">Were there none found who returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?”</span><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Then he said to him, <span class="wj">“Get up, and go your way. Your faith has healed you.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Being asked by the Pharisees when God’s Kingdom would come, he answered them, <span class="wj">“God’s Kingdom doesn’t come with observation; </span><span id="21" class="v">21 </span><span class="wj">neither will they say, ‘Look, here!’ or, ‘Look, there!’ for behold, God’s Kingdom is within you.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>He said to the disciples, <span class="wj">“The days will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it. </span><span id="23" class="v">23 </span><span class="wj">They will tell you, ‘Look, here!’ or ‘Look, there!’ Don’t go away, nor follow after them, </span><span id="24" class="v">24 </span><span class="wj">for as the lightning, when it flashes out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other part under the sky; so will the Son of Man be in his day. </span><span id="25" class="v">25 </span><span class="wj">But first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. </span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span><span class="wj">As it was in the days of Noah, even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man. </span><span id="27" class="v">27 </span><span class="wj">They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. </span><span id="28" class="v">28 </span><span class="wj">Likewise, even as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built; </span><span id="29" class="v">29 </span><span class="wj">but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky, and destroyed them all. </span><span id="30" class="v">30 </span><span class="wj">It will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed. </span><span id="31" class="v">31 </span><span class="wj">In that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back. </span><span id="32" class="v">32 </span><span class="wj">Remember Lot’s wife! </span><span id="33" class="v">33 </span><span class="wj">Whoever seeks to save his life loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it. </span><span id="34" class="v">34 </span><span class="wj">I tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will be left. </span><span id="35" class="v">35 </span><span class="wj">There will be two grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be left.”</span><span id="36" class="v">36 </span><span class="f">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>They, answering, asked him, “Where, Lord?”</p>
<p class="p">He said to them, <span class="wj">“Where the body is, there will the vultures also be gathered together.”</span></p>
<p id="18" class="c">18</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>saying, <span class="wj">“There was a judge in a certain city who didn’t fear God, and didn’t respect man. </span><span id="3" class="v">3 </span><span class="wj">A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, ‘Defend me from my adversary!’ </span><span id="4" class="v">4 </span><span class="wj">He wouldn’t for a while, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God, nor respect man, </span><span id="5" class="v">5 </span><span class="wj">yet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming.’”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>The Lord said, <span class="wj">“Listen to what the unrighteous judge says. </span><span id="7" class="v">7 </span><span class="wj">Won’t God avenge his chosen ones, who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience with them? </span><span id="8" class="v">8 </span><span class="wj">I tell you that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>He spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span><span class="wj">“Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector. </span><span id="11" class="v">11 </span><span class="wj">The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this: ‘God, I thank you, that I am not like the rest of men, extortionists, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. </span><span id="12" class="v">12 </span><span class="wj">I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.’ </span><span id="13" class="v">13 </span><span class="wj">But the tax collector, standing far away, wouldn’t even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’ </span><span id="14" class="v">14 </span><span class="wj">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>They were also bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Jesus summoned them, saying, <span class="wj">“Allow the little children to come to me, and don’t hinder them, for God’s Kingdom belongs to such as these. </span><span id="17" class="v">17 </span><span class="wj">Most certainly, I tell you, whoever doesn’t receive God’s Kingdom like a little child, he will in no way enter into it.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>A certain ruler asked him, saying, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Jesus asked him, <span class="wj">“Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one—God. </span><span id="20" class="v">20 </span><span class="wj">You know the commandments: ‘Don’t commit adultery,’ ‘Don’t murder,’ ‘Don’t steal,’ ‘Don’t give false testimony,’ ‘Honor your father and your mother.’”</span><span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>He said, “I have observed all these things from my youth up.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>When Jesus heard these things, he said to him, <span class="wj">“You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Come, follow me.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Jesus, seeing that he became very sad, said, <span class="wj">“How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into God’s Kingdom! </span><span id="25" class="v">25 </span><span class="wj">For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>But he said, <span class="wj">“The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Peter said, “Look, we have left everything, and followed you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for God’s Kingdom’s sake, </span><span id="30" class="v">30 </span><span class="wj">who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>He took the twelve aside, and said to them, <span class="wj">“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed. </span><span id="32" class="v">32 </span><span class="wj">For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on. </span><span id="33" class="v">33 </span><span class="wj">They will scourge and kill him. On the third day, he will rise again.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>They understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they didn’t understand the things that were said. <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>As he came near Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road, begging. <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>Hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant. <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>He cried out, “Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!” <span id="39" class="v">39 </span>Those who led the way rebuked him, that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, “You son of David, have mercy on me!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="40" class="v">40 </span>Standing still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him, <span id="41" class="v">41 </span><span class="wj">“What do you want me to do?”</span></p>
<p class="p">He said, “Lord, that I may see again.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="42" class="v">42 </span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="43" class="v">43 </span>Immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when they saw it, praised God.</p>
<p id="19" class="c">19</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>He entered and was passing through Jericho. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>There was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>He was trying to see who Jesus was, and couldn’t because of the crowd, because he was short. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>He ran on ahead, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was going to pass that way. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him, <span class="wj">“Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.” </span><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>He hurried, came down, and received him joyfully. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>When they saw it, they all murmured, saying, “He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor. If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times as much.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Today, salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham. </span><span id="10" class="v">10 </span><span class="wj">For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>As they heard these things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that God’s Kingdom would be revealed immediately. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>He said therefore, <span class="wj">“A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. </span><span id="13" class="v">13 </span><span class="wj">He called ten servants of his, and gave them ten mina coins, </span><span class="f">+</span><span class="wj">and told them, ‘Conduct business until I come.’ </span><span id="14" class="v">14 </span><span class="wj">But his citizens hated him, and sent an envoy after him, saying, ‘We don’t want this man to reign over us.’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span><span class="wj">“When he had come back again, having received the kingdom, he commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by conducting business. </span><span id="16" class="v">16 </span><span class="wj">The first came before him, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span><span class="wj">“He said to him, ‘Well done, you good servant! Because you were found faithful with very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.’ </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span><span class="wj">“The second came, saying, ‘Your mina, Lord, has made five minas.’ </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span><span class="wj">“So he said to him, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’ </span><span id="20" class="v">20 </span><span class="wj">Another came, saying, ‘Lord, behold, your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief, </span><span id="21" class="v">21 </span><span class="wj">for I feared you, because you are an exacting man. You take up that which you didn’t lay down, and reap that which you didn’t sow.’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span><span class="wj">“He said to him, ‘Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant! You knew that I am an exacting man, taking up that which I didn’t lay down, and reaping that which I didn’t sow. </span><span id="23" class="v">23 </span><span class="wj">Then why didn’t you deposit my money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on it?’ </span><span id="24" class="v">24 </span><span class="wj">He said to those who stood by, ‘Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has the ten minas.’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span><span class="wj">“They said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten minas!’ </span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span><span class="wj">‘For I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away from him. </span><span id="27" class="v">27 </span><span class="wj">But bring those enemies of mine who didn’t want me to reign over them here, and kill them before me.’”</span><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Having said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>When he came near to Bethsphage<span class="f">+</span> and Bethany, at the mountain that is called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples, <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>saying, <span class="wj">“Go your way into the village on the other side, in which, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, which no man had ever sat upon. Untie it, and bring it. </span><span id="31" class="v">31 </span><span class="wj">If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ say to him: ‘The Lord needs it.’”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Those who were sent went away, and found things just as he had told them. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>As they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?” <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>They said, “The Lord needs it.” <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>They brought it to Jesus. They threw their cloaks on the colt, and set Jesus on them. <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>As he went, they spread their cloaks on the road. <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>As he was now getting near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen, <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>saying, “Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! <span class="x">+</span> Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="39" class="v">39 </span>Some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="40" class="v">40 </span>He answered them, <span class="wj">“I tell you that if these were silent, the stones would cry out.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="41" class="v">41 </span>When he came near, he saw the city and wept over it, <span id="42" class="v">42 </span>saying, <span class="wj">“If you, even you, had known today the things which belong to your peace! But now, they are hidden from your eyes. </span><span id="43" class="v">43 </span><span class="wj">For the days will come on you, when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, surround you, hem you in on every side, </span><span id="44" class="v">44 </span><span class="wj">and will dash you and your children within you to the ground. They will not leave in you one stone on another, because you didn’t know the time of your visitation.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="45" class="v">45 </span>He entered into the temple, and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it, <span id="46" class="v">46 </span>saying to them, <span class="wj">“It is written, ‘My house is a house of prayer,’ </span><span class="x">+</span><span class="wj">but you have made it a ‘den of robbers’!” </span><span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="47" class="v">47 </span>He was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people sought to destroy him. <span id="48" class="v">48 </span>They couldn’t find what they might do, for all the people hung on to every word that he said.</p>
<p id="20" class="c">20</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>On one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the Good News, the<span class="f">+</span>priests and scribes came to him with the elders. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>They asked him, “Tell us: by what authority do you do these things? Or who is giving you this authority?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>He answered them, <span class="wj">“I also will ask you one question. Tell me: </span><span id="4" class="v">4 </span><span class="wj">the baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>They reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’ <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.” <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>They answered that they didn’t know where it was from.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>He began to tell the people this parable. <span class="wj">“A </span><span class="f">+</span><span class="wj">man planted a vineyard, and rented it out to some farmers, and went into another country for a long time. </span><span id="10" class="v">10 </span><span class="wj">At the proper season, he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty. </span><span id="11" class="v">11 </span><span class="wj">He sent yet another servant, and they also beat him, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty. </span><span id="12" class="v">12 </span><span class="wj">He sent yet a third, and they also wounded him, and threw him out. </span><span id="13" class="v">13 </span><span class="wj">The lord of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that seeing him, they will respect him.’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span><span class="wj">“But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.’ </span><span id="15" class="v">15 </span><span class="wj">They threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them? </span><span id="16" class="v">16 </span><span class="wj">He will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.”</span></p>
<p class="p">When they heard it, they said, “May it never be!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>But he looked at them, and said, <span class="wj">“Then what is this that is written,</span></p>
<p class="q"><span class="wj">‘The stone which the builders rejected,</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">the same was made the chief cornerstone?’</span><span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="q"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span><span class="wj">Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, </span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">but it will crush whomever it falls on to dust.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the people—for they knew he had spoken this parable against them. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>They watched him, and sent out spies, who pretended to be righteous, that they might trap him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>They asked him, “Teacher, we know that you say and teach what is right, and aren’t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, <span class="wj">“Why do you test me? </span><span id="24" class="v">24 </span><span class="wj">Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?” </span></p>
<p class="p">They answered, “Caesar’s.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>They weren’t able to trap him in his words before the people. They marveled at his answer, and were silent. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Some of the Sadducees came to him, those who deny that there is a resurrection. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>They asked him, “Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man’s brother dies having a wife, and he is childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up children for his brother. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>There were therefore seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died childless. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>The second took her as wife, and he died childless. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>The third took her, and likewise the seven all left no children, and died. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Afterward the woman also died. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them will she be? For the seven had her as a wife.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“The children of this age marry, and are given in marriage. </span><span id="35" class="v">35 </span><span class="wj">But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage. </span><span id="36" class="v">36 </span><span class="wj">For they can’t die any more, for they are like the angels, and are children of God, being children of the resurrection. </span><span id="37" class="v">37 </span><span class="wj">But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he called the Lord ‘The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ </span><span class="x">+</span><span id="38" class="v">38 </span><span class="wj">Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all are alive to him.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="39" class="v">39 </span>Some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, you speak well.” <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>They didn’t dare to ask him any more questions.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="41" class="v">41 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Why do they say that the Christ is David’s son? </span><span id="42" class="v">42 </span><span class="wj">David himself says in the book of Psalms,</span></p>
<p class="q"><span class="wj">‘The Lord said to my Lord,</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">“Sit at my right hand,</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span id="43" class="v">43 </span><span class="wj">until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.”’</span><span class="x">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="44" class="v">44 </span><span class="wj">“David therefore calls him Lord, so how is he his son?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="45" class="v">45 </span>In the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples, <span id="46" class="v">46 </span><span class="wj">“Beware of those scribes who like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts; </span><span id="47" class="v">47 </span><span class="wj">who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these will receive greater condemnation.”</span></p>
<p id="21" class="c">21</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>He looked up, and saw the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>He saw a certain poor widow casting in two small brass coins.<span class="f">+</span><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>He said, <span class="wj">“Truly I tell you, this poor widow put in more than all of them, </span><span id="4" class="v">4 </span><span class="wj">for all these put in gifts for God from their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, put in all that she had to live on.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>As some were talking about the temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts, he said, <span id="6" class="v">6 </span><span class="wj">“As for these things which you see, the days will come, in which there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be thrown down.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>They asked him, “Teacher, so when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are about to happen?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>He said, <span class="wj">“Watch out that you don’t get led astray, for many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he</span><span class="f">+</span><span class="wj">,’ and, ‘The time is at hand.’ Therefore don’t follow them. </span><span id="9" class="v">9 </span><span class="wj">When you hear of wars and disturbances, don’t be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end won’t come immediately.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Then he said to them, <span class="wj">“Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. </span><span id="11" class="v">11 </span><span class="wj">There will be great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places. There will be terrors and great signs from heaven. </span><span id="12" class="v">12 </span><span class="wj">But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my name’s sake. </span><span id="13" class="v">13 </span><span class="wj">It will turn out as a testimony for you. </span><span id="14" class="v">14 </span><span class="wj">Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer, </span><span id="15" class="v">15 </span><span class="wj">for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to contradict. </span><span id="16" class="v">16 </span><span class="wj">You will be handed over even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends. They will cause some of you to be put to death. </span><span id="17" class="v">17 </span><span class="wj">You will be hated by all men for my name’s sake. </span><span id="18" class="v">18 </span><span class="wj">And not a hair of your head will perish.</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span><span class="wj">“By your endurance you will win your lives.</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span><span class="wj">“But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand. </span><span id="21" class="v">21 </span><span class="wj">Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let those who are in the middle of her depart. Let those who are in the country not enter therein. </span><span id="22" class="v">22 </span><span class="wj">For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. </span><span id="23" class="v">23 </span><span class="wj">Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days! For there will be great distress in the land, and wrath to this people. </span><span id="24" class="v">24 </span><span class="wj">They will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. </span><span id="25" class="v">25 </span><span class="wj">There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth anxiety of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves; </span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span><span class="wj">men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. </span><span id="27" class="v">27 </span><span class="wj">Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. </span><span id="28" class="v">28 </span><span class="wj">But when these things begin to happen, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>He told them a parable. <span class="wj">“See the fig tree, and all the trees. </span><span id="30" class="v">30 </span><span class="wj">When they are already budding, you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near. </span><span id="31" class="v">31 </span><span class="wj">Even so you also, when you see these things happening, know that God’s Kingdom is near. </span><span id="32" class="v">32 </span><span class="wj">Most certainly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished. </span><span id="33" class="v">33 </span><span class="wj">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span><span class="wj">“So be careful, or your hearts will be loaded down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day will come on you suddenly. </span><span id="35" class="v">35 </span><span class="wj">For it will come like a snare on all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth. </span><span id="36" class="v">36 </span><span class="wj">Therefore be watchful all the time, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>Every day Jesus was teaching in the temple, and every night he would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called Olivet. <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>All the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him.</p>
<p id="22" class="c">22</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Satan entered into Judas, who was also called Iscariot, who was counted with the twelve. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>He went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>They were glad, and agreed to give him money. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>He consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>He sent Peter and John, saying, <span class="wj">“Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>They said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters. </span><span id="11" class="v">11 </span><span class="wj">Tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’ </span><span id="12" class="v">12 </span><span class="wj">He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>They went, found things as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer, </span><span id="16" class="v">16 </span><span class="wj">for I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in God’s Kingdom.”</span><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, <span class="wj">“Take this, and share it among yourselves, </span><span id="18" class="v">18 </span><span class="wj">for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until God’s Kingdom comes.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke, and gave it to them, saying, <span class="wj">“This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.”</span><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, <span class="wj">“This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. </span><span id="21" class="v">21 </span><span class="wj">But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table. </span><span id="22" class="v">22 </span><span class="wj">The Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>They began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>There arose also a contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’ </span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span><span class="wj">But not so with you. But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves. </span><span id="27" class="v">27 </span><span class="wj">For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn’t it he who sits at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. </span><span id="28" class="v">28 </span><span class="wj">But you are those who have continued with me in my trials. </span><span id="29" class="v">29 </span><span class="wj">I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me, </span><span id="30" class="v">30 </span><span class="wj">that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>The Lord said, <span class="wj">“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have all of you, that he might sift you as wheat, </span><span id="32" class="v">32 </span><span class="wj">but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn’t fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers.”</span><span class="f">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>He said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>He said, <span class="wj">“I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?”</span></p>
<p class="p">They said, “Nothing.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>Then he said to them, <span class="wj">“But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword. </span><span id="37" class="v">37 </span><span class="wj">For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was counted with transgressors.’</span><span class="x">+</span><span class="wj">For that which concerns me has an end.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="38" class="v">38 </span>They said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords.”</p>
<p class="p">He said to them, <span class="wj">“That is enough.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="39" class="v">39 </span>He came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him. <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>When he was at the place, he said to them, <span class="wj">“Pray that you don’t enter into temptation.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="41" class="v">41 </span>He was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and he knelt down and prayed, <span id="42" class="v">42 </span>saying, <span class="wj">“Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="43" class="v">43 </span>An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. <span id="44" class="v">44 </span>Being in agony he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="45" class="v">45 </span>When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of grief, <span id="46" class="v">46 </span>and said to them, <span class="wj">“Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="47" class="v">47 </span>While he was still speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him. <span id="48" class="v">48 </span>But Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="49" class="v">49 </span>When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?” <span id="50" class="v">50 </span>A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="51" class="v">51 </span>But Jesus answered, <span class="wj">“Let me at least do this”</span>—and he touched his ear, and healed him. <span id="52" class="v">52 </span>Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, <span class="wj">“Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? </span><span id="53" class="v">53 </span><span class="wj">When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn’t stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="54" class="v">54 </span>They seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed from a distance. <span id="55" class="v">55 </span>When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Peter sat among them. <span id="56" class="v">56 </span>A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, “This man also was with him.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="57" class="v">57 </span>He denied Jesus, saying, “Woman, I don’t know him.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="58" class="v">58 </span>After a little while someone else saw him, and said, “You also are one of them!”</p>
<p class="p">But Peter answered, “Man, I am not!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="59" class="v">59 </span>After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, “Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="60" class="v">60 </span>But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!” Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. <span id="61" class="v">61 </span>The Lord turned, and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord’s word, how he said to him, <span class="wj">“Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.”</span><span id="62" class="v">62 </span>He went out, and wept bitterly.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="63" class="v">63 </span>The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him. <span id="64" class="v">64 </span>Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?” <span id="65" class="v">65 </span>They spoke many other things against him, insulting him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="66" class="v">66 </span>As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people were gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying, <span id="67" class="v">67 </span>“If you are the Christ, tell us.”</p>
<p class="p">But he said to them, <span class="wj">“If I tell you, you won’t believe, </span><span id="68" class="v">68 </span><span class="wj">and if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go. </span><span id="69" class="v">69 </span><span class="wj">From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="70" class="v">70 </span>They all said, “Are you then the Son of God?”</p>
<p class="p">He said to them, <span class="wj">“You say it, because I am.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="71" class="v">71 </span>They said, “Why do we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!”</p>
<p id="23" class="c">23</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”</p>
<p class="p">He answered him, <span class="wj">“So you say.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>But they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.” <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>When he found out that he was in Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and behold, having examined him before you, I found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>I will therefore chastise him and release him.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.<span class="f">+</span><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>But they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!”— <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus, <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>but they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>He said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.” <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>But Jesus, turning to them, said, <span class="wj">“Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. </span><span id="29" class="v">29 </span><span class="wj">For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’ </span><span id="30" class="v">30 </span><span class="wj">Then they will begin to tell the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’</span><span class="x">+</span><span id="31" class="v">31 </span><span class="wj">For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Jesus said, <span class="wj">“Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.”</span></p>
<p class="p">Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots.
    <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar, <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="38" class="v">38 </span>An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="39" class="v">39 </span>One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, “If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="40" class="v">40 </span>But the other answered, and rebuking him said, “Don’t you even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation? <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.” <span id="42" class="v">42 </span>He said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="43" class="v">43 </span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="44" class="v">44 </span>It was now about the sixth hour,<span class="f">+</span> and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.<span class="f">+</span><span id="45" class="v">45 </span>The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two. <span id="46" class="v">46 </span>Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, <span class="wj">“Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!”</span> Having said this, he breathed his last.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="47" class="v">47 </span>When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this was a righteous man.” <span id="48" class="v">48 </span>All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their breasts. <span id="49" class="v">49 </span>All his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="50" class="v">50 </span>Behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man <span id="51" class="v">51 </span>(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for God’s Kingdom: <span id="52" class="v">52 </span>this man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body. <span id="53" class="v">53 </span>He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid. <span id="54" class="v">54 </span>It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near. <span id="55" class="v">55 </span>The women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid. <span id="56" class="v">56 </span>They returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</p>
<p id="24" class="c">24</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>They found the stone rolled away from the tomb. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>They entered in, and didn’t find the Lord Jesus’ body. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>While they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth.</p>
<p class="p">They said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?
    <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>He isn’t here, but is risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee, <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>They remembered his words, <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them told these things to the apostles. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn’t believe them. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia<span class="f">+</span> from Jerusalem. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>They talked with each other about all of these things which had happened. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>While they talked and questioned together, Jesus himself came near, and went with them. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“What are you talking about as you walk, and are sad?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things which have happened there in these days?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“What things?”</span></p>
<p class="p">They said to him, “The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;
    <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>But we were hoping that it was he who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Also, certain women of our company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb; <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>and when they didn’t find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just like the women had said, but they didn’t see him.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! </span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span><span class="wj">Didn’t the Christ have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?”</span><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>They came near to the village, where they were going, and he acted like he would go further.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>They urged him, saying, “Stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is almost over.”</p>
<p class="p">He went in to stay with them.
    <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>When he had sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks. Breaking it, he gave it to them. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>They said to one another, “Weren’t our hearts burning within us, while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?” <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>They rose up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them, <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>saying, “The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!” <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>They related the things that happened along the way, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>As they said these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, <span class="wj">“Peace be to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="38" class="v">38 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Why are you troubled? Why do doubts arise in your hearts? </span><span id="39" class="v">39 </span><span class="wj">See my hands and my feet, that it is truly me. Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn’t have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.”</span><span id="40" class="v">40 </span>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>While they still didn’t believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them, <span class="wj">“Do you have anything here to eat?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="42" class="v">42 </span>They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb. <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>He took them, and ate in front of them. <span id="44" class="v">44 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“This is what I told you, while I was still with you, that all things which are written in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me must be fulfilled.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="45" class="v">45 </span>Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the Scriptures. <span id="46" class="v">46 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, </span><span id="47" class="v">47 </span><span class="wj">and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem. </span><span id="48" class="v">48 </span><span class="wj">You are witnesses of these things. </span><span id="49" class="v">49 </span><span class="wj">Behold, I send out the promise of my Father on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="50" class="v">50 </span>He led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. <span id="51" class="v">51 </span>While he blessed them, he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven. <span id="52" class="v">52 </span>They worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, <span id="53" class="v">53 </span>and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</p>
