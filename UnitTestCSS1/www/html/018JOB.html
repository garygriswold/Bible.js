<p class="mt2">The Book of</p>
<p class="mt">Job</p>
<p id="1" class="c">1</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God,<span class="f">+</span> and turned away from evil. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>There were born to him seven sons and three daughters. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts.” Job did so continually.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Now on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh,<span class="f">+</span> Satan also came among them. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”</p>
<p class="p">Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant, Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing? <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Haven’t you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold,<span class="f">+</span> all that he has is in your power. Only on himself don’t stretch out your hand.”</p>
<p class="p">So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh.
    <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>that there came a messenger to Job, and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them, <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>While he was still speaking, there also came another, and said, “The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshiped. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>He said, “Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there. Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away. Blessed be Yahweh’s name.” <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>In all this, Job did not sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing.</p>
<p id="2" class="c">2</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Again, on the day when the God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”</p>
<p class="p">Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>But stretch out your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Then his wife said to him, “Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?”</p>
<p class="p">In all this Job didn’t sin with his lips.
    <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn’t recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.</p>
<p id="3" class="c">3</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Job answered:</p>
<p class="q"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>“Let the day perish in which I was born,</p>
<p class="q2">the night which said, ‘There is a boy conceived.’</p>
<p class="q"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Let that day be darkness.</p>
<p class="q2">Don’t let God from above seek for it,</p>
<p class="q2">neither let the light shine on it.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own.</p>
<p class="q2">Let a cloud dwell on it.</p>
<p class="q2">Let all that makes black the day terrify it.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it.</p>
<p class="q2">Let it not rejoice among the days of the year.</p>
<p class="q2">Let it not come into the number of the months.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Behold, let that night be barren.</p>
<p class="q2">Let no joyful voice come therein.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Let them curse it who curse the day,</p>
<p class="q2">who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Let the stars of its twilight be dark.</p>
<p class="q2">Let it look for light, but have none,</p>
<p class="q2">neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>because it didn’t shut up the doors of my mother’s womb,</p>
<p class="q2">nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>“Why didn’t I die from the womb?</p>
<p class="q2">Why didn’t I give up the spirit when my mother bore me?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Why did the knees receive me?</p>
<p class="q2">Or why the breast, that I should nurse?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>For now should I have lain down and been quiet.</p>
<p class="q2">I should have slept, then I would have been at rest,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>with kings and counselors of the earth,</p>
<p class="q2">who built up waste places for themselves;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>or with princes who had gold,</p>
<p class="q2">who filled their houses with silver:</p>
<p class="q"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been,</p>
<p class="q2">as infants who never saw light.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>There the wicked cease from troubling.</p>
<p class="q2">There the weary are at rest.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>There the prisoners are at ease together.</p>
<p class="q2">They don’t hear the voice of the taskmaster.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>The small and the great are there.</p>
<p class="q2">The servant is free from his master.</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>“Why is light given to him who is in misery,</p>
<p class="q2">life to the bitter in soul,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Who long for death, but it doesn’t come;</p>
<p class="q2">and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>who rejoice exceedingly,</p>
<p class="q2">and are glad, when they can find the grave?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,</p>
<p class="q2">whom God has hedged in?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>For my sighing comes before I eat.</p>
<p class="q2">My groanings are poured out like water.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>For the thing which I fear comes on me,</p>
<p class="q2">That which I am afraid of comes to me.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest;</p>
<p class="q2">but trouble comes.”</p>
<p id="4" class="c">4</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved?</p>
<p class="q2">But who can withhold himself from speaking?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Behold, you have instructed many,</p>
<p class="q2">you have strengthened the weak hands.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Your words have supported him who was falling,</p>
<p class="q2">You have made firm the feeble knees.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>But now it has come to you, and you faint.</p>
<p class="q2">It touches you, and you are troubled.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Isn’t your piety your confidence?</p>
<p class="q2">Isn’t the integrity of your ways your hope?</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>“Remember, now, whoever perished, being innocent?</p>
<p class="q2">Or where were the upright cut off?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity,</p>
<p class="q2">and sow trouble,</p>
<p class="q2">reap the same.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>By the breath of God they perish.</p>
<p class="q2">By the blast of his anger are they consumed.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>The roaring of the lion,</p>
<p class="q2">and the voice of the fierce lion,</p>
<p class="q2">the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>The old lion perishes for lack of prey.</p>
<p class="q2">The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad.</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>“Now a thing was secretly brought to me.</p>
<p class="q2">My ear received a whisper of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>In thoughts from the visions of the night,</p>
<p class="q2">when deep sleep falls on men,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>fear came on me, and trembling,</p>
<p class="q2">which made all my bones shake.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Then a spirit passed before my face.</p>
<p class="q2">The hair of my flesh stood up.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>It stood still, but I couldn’t discern its appearance.</p>
<p class="q2">A form was before my eyes.</p>
<p class="q2">Silence, then I heard a voice, saying,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>‘Shall mortal man be more just than God?</p>
<p class="q2">Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Behold, he puts no trust in his servants.</p>
<p class="q2">He charges his angels with error.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>How much more, those who dwell in houses of clay,</p>
<p class="q2">whose foundation is in the dust,</p>
<p class="q2">who are crushed before the moth!</p>
<p class="q"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Between morning and evening they are destroyed.</p>
<p class="q2">They perish forever without any regarding it.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Isn’t their tent cord plucked up within them?</p>
<p class="q2">They die, and that without wisdom.’</p>
<p id="5" class="c">5</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>“Call now; is there any who will answer you?</p>
<p class="q2">To which of the holy ones will you turn?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>For resentment kills the foolish man,</p>
<p class="q2">and jealousy kills the simple.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>I have seen the foolish taking root,</p>
<p class="q2">but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>His children are far from safety.</p>
<p class="q2">They are crushed in the gate.</p>
<p class="q2">Neither is there any to deliver them,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>whose harvest the hungry eats up,</p>
<p class="q2">and take it even out of the thorns.</p>
<p class="q2">The snare gapes for their substance.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>For affliction doesn’t come out of the dust,</p>
<p class="q2">neither does trouble spring out of the ground;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>but man is born to trouble,</p>
<p class="q2">as the sparks fly upward.</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>“But as for me, I would seek God.</p>
<p class="q2">I would commit my cause to God,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>who does great things that can’t be fathomed,</p>
<p class="q2">marvelous things without number;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>who gives rain on the earth,</p>
<p class="q2">and sends waters on the fields;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>so that he sets up on high those who are low,</p>
<p class="q2">those who mourn are exalted to safety.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>He frustrates the devices of the crafty,</p>
<p class="q2">So that their hands can’t perform their enterprise.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>He takes the wise in their own craftiness;</p>
<p class="q2">the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>They meet with darkness in the day time,</p>
<p class="q2">and grope at noonday as in the night.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>But he saves from the sword of their mouth,</p>
<p class="q2">even the needy from the hand of the mighty.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>So the poor has hope,</p>
<p class="q2">and injustice shuts her mouth.</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>“Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects.</p>
<p class="q2">Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>For he wounds, and binds up.</p>
<p class="q2">He injures, and his hands make whole.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>He will deliver you in six troubles;</p>
<p class="q2">yes, in seven no evil shall touch you.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>In famine he will redeem you from death;</p>
<p class="q2">in war, from the power of the sword.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,</p>
<p class="q2">neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>At destruction and famine you shall laugh,</p>
<p class="q2">neither shall you be afraid of the animals of the earth.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>For you shall be allied with the stones of the field.</p>
<p class="q2">The animals of the field shall be at peace with you.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>You shall know that your tent is in peace.</p>
<p class="q2">You shall visit your fold, and shall miss nothing.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>You shall know also that your offspring<span class="f">+</span> shall be great,</p>
<p class="q2">Your offspring as the grass of the earth.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>You shall come to your grave in a full age,</p>
<p class="q2">like a shock of grain comes in its season.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Look this, we have searched it, so it is.</p>
<p class="q2">Hear it, and know it for your good.”</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p id="6" class="c">6</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Then Job answered,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Oh that my anguish were weighed,</p>
<p class="q2">and all my calamity laid in the balances!</p>
<p class="q"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas,</p>
<p class="q2">therefore have my words been rash.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>For the arrows of the Almighty are within me.</p>
<p class="q2">My spirit drinks up their poison.</p>
<p class="q">The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass?</p>
<p class="q">Or does the ox low over his fodder?</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt?</p>
<p class="q">Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>My soul refuses to touch them.</p>
<p class="q">They are as loathsome food to me.</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>“Oh that I might have my request,</p>
<p class="q2">that God would grant the thing that I long for,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>even that it would please God to crush me;</p>
<p class="q2">that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</p>
<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Be it still my consolation,</p>
<p class="q2">yes, let me exult in pain that doesn’t spare,</p>
<p class="q2">that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>What is my strength, that I should wait?</p>
<p class="q2">What is my end, that I should be patient?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Is my strength the strength of stones?</p>
<p class="q2">Or is my flesh of brass?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Isn’t it that I have no help in me,</p>
<p class="q2">That wisdom is driven quite from me?</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>“To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his friend;</p>
<p class="q2">even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook,</p>
<p class="q2">as the channel of brooks that pass away;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Which are black by reason of the ice,</p>
<p class="q2">in which the snow hides itself.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>In the dry season, they vanish.</p>
<p class="q2">When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>The caravans that travel beside them turn aside.</p>
<p class="q2">They go up into the waste, and perish.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>The caravans of Tema looked.</p>
<p class="q2">The companies of Sheba waited for them.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>They were distressed because they were confident.</p>
<p class="q2">They came there, and were confounded.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>For now you are nothing.</p>
<p class="q2">You see a terror, and are afraid.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Did I say, ‘Give to me?’</p>
<p class="q2">or, ‘Offer a present for me from your substance?’</p>
<p class="q"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>or, ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand?’</p>
<p class="q2">or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?’</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>“Teach me, and I will hold my peace.</p>
<p class="q2">Cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>How forcible are words of uprightness!</p>
<p class="q2">But your reproof, what does it reprove?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Do you intend to reprove words,</p>
<p class="q2">since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless,</p>
<p class="q2">and make merchandise of your friend.</p>

<p class="p">The words of Job are ended.</p>

<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind,</p>

<p id="42" class="c">42</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Then Job answered Yahweh,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“I know that you can do all things,</p>
<p class="q2">and that no purpose of yours can be restrained.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>You asked, ‘Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?’</p>
<p class="q2">therefore I have uttered that which I did not understand,</p>
<p class="q2">things too wonderful for me, which I didn’t know.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>You said, ‘Listen, now, and I will speak;</p>
<p class="q2">I will question you, and you will answer me.’</p>
<p class="q"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,</p>
<p class="q2">but now my eye sees you.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Therefore I abhor myself,</p>
<p class="q2">and repent in dust and ashes.”</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>It was so, that after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Now therefore, take to yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept him, that I not deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did what Yahweh commanded them, and Yahweh accepted Job.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Yahweh turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends. Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Then came there to him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house. They comforted him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him. Everyone also gave him a piece of money,<span class="f">+</span> and everyone a ring of gold.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>He had also seven sons and three daughters. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>He called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren Happuch. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>In all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job. Their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>After this Job lived one hundred forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, to four generations. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>So Job died, being old and full of days.</p>
