<p class="q"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>He has laid my vine waste,</p>

<p class="q">As the dawn spreading on the mountains,</p>
<p class="q2">a great and strong people;</p>
<p class="q2">there has never been the like,</p>
<p class="q2">neither will there be any more after them,</p>
<p class="q2">even to the years of many generations.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>A fire devours before them,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>At their presence the peoples are in anguish.</p>
<p class="q2">All faces have grown pale.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>They run like mighty men.</p>
<p class="q2">They climb the wall like warriors.</p>
<p class="q2">They each march in his line, and they don’t swerve off course.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Neither does one jostle another;</p>
<p class="q2">they march everyone in his path,</p>
<p class="q2">and they burst through the defenses,</p>
<p class="q2">and don’t break ranks.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>They rush on the city.</p>
<p class="q2">They run on the wall.</p>
<p class="q2">They climb up into the houses.</p>
<p class="q2">They enter in at the windows like thieves.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>The earth quakes before them.</p>
<p class="q2">The heavens tremble.</p>
<p class="q2">The sun and the moon are darkened,</p>
<p class="q2">and the stars withdraw their shining.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Yahweh thunders his voice before his army;</p>
<p class="q2">for his forces are very great;</p>
<p class="q2">for he is strong who obeys his command;</p>
<p class="q2">for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome,</p>
<p class="q2">and who can endure it?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>“Yet even now,” says Yahweh, “turn to me with all your heart,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Tear your heart, and not your garments,</p>
<p class="q2">and turn to Yahweh, your God;</p>
<p class="q2">for he is gracious and merciful,</p>
<p class="q2">slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness,</p>
<p class="q2">and relents from sending calamity.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Who knows? He may turn and relent,</p>
<p class="q2">and leave a blessing behind him,</p>
<p class="q2">even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh, your God.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Blow the trumpet in Zion!</p>
<p class="q2">Sanctify a fast.</p>
<p class="q2">Call a solemn assembly.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Gather the people.</p>
<p class="q2">Sanctify the assembly.</p>
<p class="q2">Assemble the elders.</p>
<p class="q2">Gather the children, and those who nurse from breasts.</p>
<p class="q">Let the bridegroom go out of his room,</p>
<p class="q2">and the bride out of her room.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep between the porch and the altar,</p>
<p class="q2">and let them say, “Spare your people, Yahweh,</p>
<p class="q2">and don’t give your heritage to reproach,</p>
<p class="q2">that the nations should rule over them.</p>
<p class="q">Why should they say among the peoples,</p>
<p class="q2">‘Where is their God?’”</p>
<p class="q"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Then Yahweh was jealous for his land,</p>
<p class="q2">And had pity on his people.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Yahweh answered his people,</p>
<p class="q2">“Behold,<span class="f">+</span> I will send you grain, new wine, and oil,</p>

<p class="q2">and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>But I will remove the northern army far away from you,</p>

<p class="q2">its front into the eastern sea,</p>
<p class="q2">and its back into the western sea;</p>
<p class="q2">and its stench will come up,</p>
<p class="q2">and its bad smell will rise.”</p>
<p class="q">Surely he has done great things.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Land, don’t be afraid.</p>
<p class="q2">Be glad and rejoice, for Yahweh has done great things.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Don’t be afraid, you animals of the field;</p>
<p class="q2">for the pastures of the wilderness spring up,</p>
<p class="q2">for the tree bears its fruit.</p>
<p class="q2">The fig tree and the vine yield their strength.</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>“Be glad then, you children of Zion,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>You will have plenty to eat, and be satisfied,</p>

<p class="q2">They have divided my land,</p>
