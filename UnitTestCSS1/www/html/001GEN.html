<p class="mt2">The First Book of Moses,</p>
<p class="mt3">Commonly Called</p>
<p class="mt">Genesis</p>
<p id="1" class="c">1</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>In the beginning, God<span class="f">+</span> created the heavens and the earth. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>The earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep and God’s Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>God called the light “day”, and the darkness he called “night”. There was evening and there was morning, the first day.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>God said, “Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.” <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>God called the expanse “sky”. There was evening and there was morning, a second day.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>God called the dry land “earth”, and the gathering together of the waters he called “seas”. God saw that it was good. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>God said, “Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seeds, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with their seeds in it, on the earth”; and it was so. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>The earth yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with their seeds in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>There was evening and there was morning, a third day.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs to mark seasons, days, and years; <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>and let them be for lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth”; and it was so. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light to the earth, <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>God said, “Let the waters abound with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.” <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>God created the large sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>God said, “Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind”; and it was so. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>God created man in his own image. In God’s image he created him; male and female he created them. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>God blessed them. God said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>God said, “Behold,<span class="f">+</span> I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food;” and it was so.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.</p>
<p id="2" class="c">2</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The heavens, the earth, and all their vast array were finished. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>On the seventh day God finished his work which he had done; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because he rested in it from all his work of creation which he had done.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Yahweh<span class="f">+</span> God made the earth and the heavens. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth. There was not a man to till the ground, <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food, including the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became the source of four rivers. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>The name of the first is Pishon: it flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>and the gold of that land is good. Bdellium<span class="f">+</span> and onyx stone are also there. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>The name of the second river is Gihon. It is the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>The name of the third river is Hiddekel. This is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Yahweh God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, “You may freely eat of every tree of the garden; <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Yahweh God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make him a helper comparable to<span class="f">+</span> him.” <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called every living creature became its name. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper comparable to him. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Yahweh God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep. As the man slept, he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Yahweh God made a woman from the rib which he had taken from the man, and brought her to the man. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>The man said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called ‘woman,’ because she was taken out of Man.” <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>The man and his wife were both naked, and they were not ashamed.</p>
<p id="3" class="c">3</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which Yahweh God had made. He said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden, <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>but not the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God has said, ‘You shall not eat of it. You shall not touch it, lest you die.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>The serpent said to the woman, “You won’t really die, <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took some of its fruit, and ate; and she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate it, too. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Their eyes were opened, and they both knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made coverings for themselves. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>They heard Yahweh God’s voice walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>The man said, “I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Yahweh God said to the woman, “What have you done?”</p>
<p class="p">The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Yahweh God said to the serpent,</p>
<p class="q">“Because you have done this,</p>
<p class="q2">you are cursed above all livestock,</p>
<p class="q2">and above every animal of the field.</p>
<p class="q">You shall go on your belly</p>
<p class="q2">and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>I will put hostility between you and the woman,</p>
<p class="q2">and between your offspring and her offspring.</p>
<p class="q">He will bruise your head,</p>
<p class="q2">and you will bruise his heel.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>To the woman he said,</p>
<p class="q">“I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth.</p>
<p class="q2">In pain you will bear children.</p>
<p class="q">Your desire will be for your husband,</p>
<p class="q2">and he will rule over you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>To Adam he said,</p>
<p class="q">“Because you have listened to your wife’s voice,</p>
<p class="q2">and ate from the tree,</p>
<p class="q2">about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat of it,’</p>
<p class="q2">the ground is cursed for your sake.</p>
<p class="q">You will eat from it with much labor all the days of your life.</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>It will yield thorns and thistles to you;</p>
<p class="q2">and you will eat the herb of the field.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>By the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground,</p>
<p class="q2">for out of it you were taken.</p>
<p class="q">For you are dust,</p>
<p class="q2">and to dust you shall return.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>The man called his wife Eve because she would be the mother of all the living. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Yahweh God made coats of animal skins for Adam and for his wife, and clothed them.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Yahweh God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever—” <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Therefore Yahweh God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>So he drove out the man; and he placed cherubim<span class="f">+</span> at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.</p>
<p id="4" class="c">4</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The man knew<span class="f">+</span> Eve his wife. She conceived,<span class="f">+</span> and gave birth to Cain, and said, “I have gotten a man with Yahweh’s help.” <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Again she gave birth, to Cain’s brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>As time passed, Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. Yahweh respected Abel and his offering, <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>but he didn’t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Yahweh said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen? <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>If you do well, won’t it be lifted up? If you don’t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it.” <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Cain said to Abel, his brother, “Let’s go into the field.” While they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Yahweh said to Cain, “Where is Abel, your brother?”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “I don’t know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Yahweh said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries to me from the ground. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>From now on, when you till the ground, it won’t yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Cain said to Yahweh, “My punishment is greater than I can bear. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Behold, you have driven me out today from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. Whoever finds me will kill me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Yahweh said to him, “Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold.” Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, so that anyone finding him would not strike him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Cain left Yahweh’s presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Cain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>To Enoch was born Irad. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Lamech took two wives: the name of the first one was Adah, and the name of the second one was Zillah. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>His brother’s name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron. Tubal Cain’s sister was Naamah. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Lamech said to his wives,</p>
<p class="q">“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice.</p>
<p class="q2">You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech,</p>
<p class="q">for I have slain a man for wounding me,</p>
<p class="q2">a young man for bruising me.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>If Cain will be avenged seven times,</p>
<p class="q2">truly Lamech seventy-seven times.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, saying, “for God has given me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.” <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>A son was also born to Seth, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on Yahweh’s name.</p>
<p id="5" class="c">5</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him in God’s likeness. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>He created them male and female, and blessed them. On the day they were created, he named them “Adam”.<span class="f">+</span><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Adam lived one hundred thirty years, and became the father of a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years, and he became the father of other sons and daughters. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>All the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years, then he died.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Seth lived one hundred five years, then became the father of Enosh. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Seth lived after he became the father of Enosh eight hundred seven years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>All of the days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years, then he died.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Enosh lived ninety years, and became the father of Kenan. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Enosh lived after he became the father of Kenan, eight hundred fifteen years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>All of the days of Enosh were nine hundred five years, then he died.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Kenan lived seventy years, then became the father of Mahalalel. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Kenan lived after he became the father of Mahalalel eight hundred forty years, and became the father of other sons and daughters <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>and all of the days of Kenan were nine hundred ten years, then he died.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, then became the father of Jared. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Mahalalel lived after he became the father of Jared eight hundred thirty years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>All of the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety-five years, then he died.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Jared lived one hundred sixty-two years, then became the father of Enoch. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Jared lived after he became the father of Enoch eight hundred years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>All of the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years, then he died.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Enoch lived sixty-five years, then became the father of Methuselah. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>After Methuselah’s birth, Enoch walked with God for three hundred years, and became the father of more sons and daughters. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>All the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Enoch walked with God, and he was not found, for God took him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Methuselah lived one hundred eighty-seven years, then became the father of Lamech. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Methuselah lived after he became the father of Lamech seven hundred eighty-two years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>All the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years, then he died.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Lamech lived one hundred eighty-two years, then became the father of a son. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>He named him Noah, saying, “This one will comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, caused by the ground which Yahweh has cursed.” <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Lamech lived after he became the father of Noah five hundred ninety-five years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>All the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years, then he died.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Noah was five hundred years old, then Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</p>
<p id="6" class="c">6</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>When men began to multiply on the surface of the ground, and daughters were born to them, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>God’s sons saw that men’s daughters were beautiful, and they took any that they wanted for themselves as wives. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Yahweh said, “My Spirit will not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; so his days will be one hundred twenty years.” <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>The Nephilim<span class="f">+</span> were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when God’s sons came in to men’s daughters and had children with them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of man’s heart was continually only evil. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Yahweh was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Yahweh said, “I will destroy man whom I have created from the surface of the ground—man, along with animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky—for I am sorry that I have made them.” <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>But Noah found favor in Yahweh’s eyes.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>This is the history of the generations of Noah: Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time. Noah walked with God. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>God saw the earth, and saw that it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>God said to Noah, “I will bring an end to all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them and the earth. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Make a ship of gopher wood. You shall make rooms in the ship, and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>This is how you shall make it. The length of the ship shall be three hundred cubits,<span class="f">+</span> its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>You shall make a roof in the ship, and you shall finish it to a cubit upward. You shall set the door of the ship in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>I, even I, do bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky. Everything that is in the earth will die. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>But I will establish my covenant with you. You shall come into the ship, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ship, to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Of the birds after their kind, of the livestock after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort will come to you, to keep them alive. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Take with you some of all food that is eaten, and gather it to yourself; and it will be for food for you, and for them.” <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Thus Noah did. He did all that God commanded him.</p>
<p id="7" class="c">7</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Yahweh said to Noah, “Come with all of your household into the ship, for I have seen your righteousness before me in this generation. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>You shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you, the male and his female. Of the animals that are not clean, take two, the male and his female. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Also of the birds of the sky, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive on the surface of all the earth. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights. I will destroy every living thing that I have made from the surface of the ground.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Noah did everything that Yahweh commanded him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Noah went into the ship with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, because of the floodwaters. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Clean animals, unclean animals, birds, and everything that creeps on the ground <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>went by pairs to Noah into the ship, male and female, as God commanded Noah. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>After the seven days, the floodwaters came on the earth. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all the fountains of the great deep were burst open, and the sky’s windows were opened. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>It rained on the earth forty days and forty nights.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>In the same day Noah, and Shem, Ham, and Japheth—the sons of Noah—and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ship— <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>they, and every animal after its kind, all the livestock after their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Pairs from all flesh with the breath of life in them went into the ship to Noah. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Those who went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him; then Yahweh shut him in. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>The flood was forty days on the earth. The waters increased, and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>The waters rose, and increased greatly on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>The waters rose very high on the earth. All the high mountains that were under the whole sky were covered. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>The waters rose fifteen cubits<span class="f">+</span> higher, and the mountains were covered. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>All flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds, livestock, animals, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>All on the dry land, in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground, including man, livestock, creeping things, and birds of the sky. They were destroyed from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ship. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>The waters flooded the earth one hundred fifty days.</p>
<p id="8" class="c">8</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>God remembered Noah, all the animals, and all the livestock that were with him in the ship; and God made a wind to pass over the earth. The waters subsided. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>The deep’s fountains and the sky’s windows were also stopped, and the rain from the sky was restrained. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>The waters continually receded from the earth. After the end of one hundred fifty days the waters decreased. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>The ship rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on Ararat’s mountains. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>The waters receded continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were visible.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>At the end of forty days, Noah opened the window of the ship which he had made, <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>and he sent out a raven. It went back and forth, until the waters were dried up from the earth. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>He himself sent out a dove to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground, <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>but the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned into the ship to him, for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth. He put out his hand, and took her, and brought her to him into the ship. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>He waited yet another seven days; and again he sent the dove out of the ship. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>The dove came back to him at evening and, behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>He waited yet another seven days, and sent out the dove; and she didn’t return to him anymore.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>In the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth. Noah removed the covering of the ship, and looked. He saw that the surface of the ground was dried. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>God spoke to Noah, saying, <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>“Go out of the ship, you, your wife, your sons, and your sons’ wives with you. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Noah went out, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives with him. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves on the earth, after their families, went out of the ship.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Yahweh smelled the pleasant aroma. Yahweh said in his heart, “I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake because the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth. I will never again strike every living thing, as I have done. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night will not cease.”</p>
<p id="9" class="c">9</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the earth. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky. Everything that moves along the ground, and all the fish of the sea, are delivered into your hand. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Every moving thing that lives will be food for you. As I gave you the green herb, I have given everything to you. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>But flesh with its life, that is, its blood, you shall not eat. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>I will surely require your blood of your lives; at the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, I will require the life of man. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Whoever sheds man’s blood, his blood will be shed by man, for God made man in his own image. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Be fruitful and multiply. Increase abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying, <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>“As for me, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your offspring after you, <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the livestock, and every animal of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>I will establish my covenant with you: All flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood. There will never again be a flood to destroy the earth.” <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>God said, “This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be a sign of a covenant between me and the earth. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>When I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud, <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>The rainbow will be in the cloud. I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.” <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>God said to Noah, “This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>The sons of Noah who went out from the ship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham is the father of Canaan. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>These three were the sons of Noah, and from these, the whole earth was populated.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Noah began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>He drank of the wine and got drunk. He was uncovered within his tent. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were backwards, and they didn’t see their father’s nakedness. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done to him. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>He said,</p>
<p class="q">“Canaan is cursed.</p>
<p class="q2">He will be a servant of servants to his brothers.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>He said,</p>
<p class="q">“Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem.</p>
<p class="q2">Let Canaan be his servant.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>May God enlarge Japheth.</p>
<p class="q2">Let him dwell in the tents of Shem.</p>
<p class="q2">Let Canaan be his servant.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Noah lived three hundred fifty years after the flood. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>All the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years, and then he died.</p>
<p id="10" class="c">10</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now this is the history of the generations of the sons of Noah and of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>The sons of Japheth were: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>The sons of Gomer were: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>The sons of Javan were: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands, everyone after his language, after their families, in their nations.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>The sons of Ham were: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>The sons of Cush were: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah were: Sheba and Dedan. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Cush became the father of Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the earth. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>He was a mighty hunter before Yahweh. Therefore it is said, “like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Yahweh”. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Out of that land he went into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah, <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>and Resen between Nineveh and the great city Calah. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Mizraim became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the Philistines descended from), and Caphtorim.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Canaan became the father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth, <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon—as you go toward Gerar—to Gaza—as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim—to Lasha. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>These are the sons of Ham, after their families, according to their languages, in their lands and their nations.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Children were also born to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>The sons of Shem were: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>The sons of Aram were: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Arpachshad became the father of Shelah. Shelah became the father of Eber. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>To Eber were born two sons. The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided. His brother’s name was Joktan. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Obal, Abimael, Sheba, <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Their dwelling extended from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>These are the sons of Shem, by their families, according to their languages, lands, and nations.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>These are the families of the sons of Noah, by their generations, according to their nations. The nations divided from these in the earth after the flood.</p>
<p id="11" class="c">11</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The whole earth was of one language and of one speech. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>As they traveled from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>They said to one another, “Come, let’s make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>They said, “Come, let’s build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let’s make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Yahweh said, “Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is what they begin to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Come, let’s go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.” <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>So Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the city. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Therefore its name was called Babel, because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth. From there, Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>This is the history of the generations of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old when he became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and became the father of more sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Arpachshad lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Shelah, and became the father of more sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Shelah lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Eber, and became the father of more sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Eber lived four hundred thirty years after he became the father of Peleg, and became the father of more sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Peleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father of Reu, and became the father of more sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Reu lived two hundred seven years after he became the father of Serug, and became the father of more sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and became the father of more sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father of Terah, and became the father of more sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Now this is the history of the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran became the father of Lot. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Abram and Nahor married wives. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran who was also the father of Iscah. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Sarai was barren. She had no child. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>Terah took Abram his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife. They went from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan. They came to Haran and lived there. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>The days of Terah were two hundred five years. Terah died in Haran.</p>
<p id="12" class="c">12</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now Yahweh said to Abram, “Leave your country, and your relatives, and your father’s house, and go to the land that I will show you. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>I will make of you a great nation. I will bless you and make your name great. You will be a blessing. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who treates you with contempt. All the families of the earth will be blessed through you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>So Abram went, as Yahweh had told him. Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his brother’s son, all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people whom they had acquired in Haran, and they went to go into the land of Canaan. They entered into the land of Canaan. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time, Canaanites were in the land.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Yahweh appeared to Abram and said, “I will give this land to your offspring.”<span class="f">+</span></p>
<p class="p">He built an altar there to Yahweh, who had appeared to him.
    <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>He left from there to go to the mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to Yahweh and called on Yahweh’s name. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Abram traveled, still going on toward the South.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>There was a famine in the land. Abram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there, for the famine was severe in the land. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>When he had come near to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>It will happen, when the Egyptians see you, that they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ They will kill me, but they will save you alive. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>When Abram had come into Egypt, Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>The princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>He dealt well with Abram for her sake. He had sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Yahweh afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this that you have done to me? Why didn’t you tell me that she was your wife? <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now therefore, see your wife, take her, and go your way.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Pharaoh commanded men concerning him, and they escorted him away with his wife and all that he had.</p>
<p id="13" class="c">13</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Abram went up out of Egypt—he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot with him—into the South. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>He went on his journeys from the South even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. There Abram called on Yahweh’s name. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, herds, and tents. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together; for their substance was great, so that they could not live together. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>There was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites lived in the land at that time. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen; for we are relatives. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Isn’t the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself. Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves the one from the other. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Yahweh.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Yahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, “Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>for all the land which you see, I will give to you, and to your offspring forever. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can count the dust of the earth, then your offspring<span class="f">+</span> may also be counted. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its width; for I will give it to you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Yahweh.</p>
<p id="14" class="c">14</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>In the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch, king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goiim, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>they made war with Bera, king of Sodom, and with Birsha, king of Gomorrah, Shinab, king of Admah, and Shemeber, king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (also called Zoar). <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>All these joined together in the valley of Siddim (also called the Salt Sea). <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>They served Chedorlaomer for twelve years, and in the thirteenth year, they rebelled. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came, and the kings who were with him, and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim, <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>and the Horites in their Mount Seir, to El Paran, which is by the wilderness. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>They returned, and came to En Mishpat (also called Kadesh), and struck all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that lived in Hazazon Tamar. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>The king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (also called Zoar) went out; and they set the battle in array against them in the valley of Siddim; <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and some fell there, and those who remained fled to the hills. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>They took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>They took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who lived in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>One who had escaped came and told Abram, the Hebrew. At that time, he lived by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and they were allies of Abram. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>When Abram heard that his relative was taken captive, he led out his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>He divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>He brought back all the goods, and also brought back his relative, Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the other people.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>The king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley). <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>He blessed him, and said, “Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth: <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand.”</p>
<p class="p">Abram gave him a tenth of all.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people, and take the goods for yourself.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have lifted up my hand to Yahweh, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth, <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’ <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion.”</p>
<p id="15" class="c">15</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>After these things Yahweh’s word came to Abram in a vision, saying, “Don’t be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Abram said, “Lord<span class="f">+</span> Yahweh, what will you give me, since I go childless, and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?” <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Abram said, “Behold, to me you have given no children<span class="f">+</span>: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Behold, Yahweh’s word came to him, saying, “This man will not be your heir, but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir.” <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Yahweh brought him outside, and said, “Look now toward the sky, and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” He said to Abram, “So will your offspring<span class="f">+</span> be.” <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>He believed in Yahweh, who credited it to him for righteousness. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>He said to Abram, “I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>He said, “Lord Yahweh, how will I know that I will inherit it?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>He brought him all these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but he didn’t divide the birds. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. Now terror and great darkness fell on him. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>He said to Abram, “Know for sure that your offspring<span class="f">+</span> will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four hundred years. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out with great wealth, <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>but you will go to your fathers in peace. You will be buried at a good old age. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>In the fourth generation they will come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.” <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch passed between these pieces. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>In that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram, saying, “I have given this land to your offspring,<span class="f">+</span> from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates: <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”</p>
<p id="16" class="c">16</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, bore him no children. She had a servant, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Sarai said to Abram, “See now, Yahweh has restrained me from bearing. Please go in to my servant. It may be that I will obtain children by her.” Abram listened to the voice of Sarai. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>He went in to Hagar, and she conceived. When she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Sarai said to Abram, “This wrong is your fault. I gave my servant into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. Yahweh judge between me and you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your maid is in your hand. Do to her whatever is good in your eyes.” Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her face.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Yahweh’s angel found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain on the way to Shur. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s servant, where did you come from? Where are you going?”</p>
<p class="p">She said, “I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Yahweh’s angel said to her, “Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hands.” <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Yahweh’s angel said to her, “I will greatly multiply your offspring,<span class="f">+</span> that they will not be counted for multitude.” <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Yahweh’s angel said to her, “Behold, you are with child, and will bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, because Yahweh has heard your affliction. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>He will be like a wild donkey among men. His hand will be against every man, and every man’s hand against him. He will live opposite all of his brothers.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>She called the name of Yahweh who spoke to her, “You are a God who sees,” for she said, “Have I even stayed alive after seeing him?” <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi.<span class="f">+</span> Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Hagar bore a son for Abram. Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.</p>
<p id="17" class="c">17</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>When Abram was ninety-nine years old, Yahweh appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am God Almighty. Walk before me, and be blameless. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Abram fell on his face. God talked with him, saying, <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>“As for me, behold, my covenant is with you. You will be the father of a multitude of nations. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Your name will no more be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you. Kings will come out of you. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring<span class="f">+</span> after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your offspring<span class="f">+</span> after you. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>I will give to you, and to your offspring<span class="f">+</span> after you, the land where you are traveling, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession. I will be their God.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>God said to Abraham, “As for you, you will keep my covenant, you and your offspring<span class="f">+</span> after you throughout their generations. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring<span class="f">+</span> after you. Every male among you shall be circumcised. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin. It will be a token of the covenant between me and you. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>He who is eight days old will be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he who is born in the house, or bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring.<span class="f">+</span><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>He who is born in your house, and he who is bought with your money, must be circumcised. My covenant will be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>The uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people. He has broken my covenant.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but her name will be Sarah. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her. Yes, I will bless her, and she will be a mother of nations. Kings of peoples will come from her.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to him who is one hundred years old? Will Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?” <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before you!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>God said, “No, but Sarah, your wife, will bear you a son. You shall call his name Isaac.<span class="f">+</span> I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his offspring<span class="f">+</span> after him. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>As for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He will become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>But my covenant I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this set time next year.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>When he finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money; every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the same day, as God had said to him. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Abraham was ninety-nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>In the same day both Abraham and Ishmael, his son, were circumcised. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>All the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.</p>
<p id="18" class="c">18</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Yahweh appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>He lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that three men stood opposite him. When he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth, <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>and said, “My lord, if now I have found favor in your sight, please don’t go away from your servant. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>I will get a morsel of bread so you can refresh your heart. After that you may go your way, now that you have come to your servant.”</p>
<p class="p">They said, “Very well, do as you have said.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, “Quickly prepare three seahs<span class="f">+</span> of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.” <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the servant. He hurried to dress it. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>He took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them. He stood by them under the tree, and they ate.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>They asked him, “Where is Sarah, your wife?”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “See, in the tent.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>He said, “I will certainly return to you at about this time next year; and behold, Sarah your wife will have a son.”</p>
<p class="p">Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.
    <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age. Sarah had passed the age of childbearing. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Sarah laughed within herself, saying, “After I have grown old will I have pleasure, my lord being old also?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Yahweh said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Will I really bear a child, yet I am old?’ <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Is anything too hard for Yahweh? At the set time I will return to you, when the season comes round, and Sarah will have a son.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Then Sarah denied it, saying, “I didn’t laugh,” for she was afraid.</p>
<p class="p">He said, “No, but you did laugh.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>The men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on their way. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Yahweh said, “Will I hide from Abraham what I do, <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>since Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him? <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.” <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Yahweh said, “Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous, <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me. If not, I will know.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>The men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham stood yet before Yahweh. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Abraham came near, and said, “Will you consume the righteous with the wicked? <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it? <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Be it far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be like the wicked. May that be far from you. Shouldn’t the Judge of all the earth do right?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Yahweh said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place for their sake.” <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Abraham answered, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord, although I am dust and ashes. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous? Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>He spoke to him yet again, and said, “What if there are forty found there?”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “I will not do it for the forty’s sake.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>He said, “Oh don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak. What if there are thirty found there?”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>He said, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord. What if there are twenty found there?”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>He said, “Oh don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak just once more. What if ten are found there?”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>Yahweh went his way, as soon as he had finished communing with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.</p>
<p id="19" class="c">19</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The two angels came to Sodom at evening. Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to the earth, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>and he said, “See now, my lords, please turn aside into your servant’s house, stay all night, wash your feet, and you can rise up early, and go on your way.”</p>
<p class="p">They said, “No, but we will stay in the street all night.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>They called to Lot, and said to him, “Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Lot went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>He said, “Please, my brothers, don’t act so wickedly. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>See now, I have two virgin daughters. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you. Only don’t do anything to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>They said, “Stand back!” Then they said, “This one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now will we deal worse with you, than with them!” They pressed hard on the man Lot, and came near to break the door. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>But the men reached out their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>They struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>The men said to Lot, “Do you have anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whoever you have in the city, bring them out of the place: <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown so great before Yahweh that Yahweh has sent us to destroy it.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters, and said, “Get up! Get out of this place, for Yahweh will destroy the city.”</p>
<p class="p">But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking.
    <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, “Get up! Take your wife, and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.” <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife’s hand, and his two daughters’ hands, Yahweh being merciful to him; and they took him out, and set him outside of the city. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, “Escape for your life! Don’t look behind you, and don’t stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Lot said to them, “Oh, not so, my lord. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>See now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can’t escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (isn’t it a little one?), and my soul will live.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>He said to him, “Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Hurry, escape there, for I can’t do anything until you get there.” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.<span class="f">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh out of the sky. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Yahweh. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and looked, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>When God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>The firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Come, let’s make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line<span class="f">+</span>.” <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>They made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she arose. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine again, tonight. You go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.<span class="f">+</span>” <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>They made their father drink wine that night also. The younger went and lay with him. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she got up. <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>Thus both of Lot’s daughters were with child by their father. <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day. <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi. He is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.</p>
<p id="20" class="c">20</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the South, and lived between Kadesh and Shur. He lived as a foreigner in Gerar. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Abraham said about Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken. For she is a man’s wife.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Now Abimelech had not come near her. He said, “Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation? <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Didn’t he tell me, ‘She is my sister?’ She, even she herself, said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn’t allow you to touch her. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Now therefore, restore the man’s wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If you don’t restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. The men were very scared. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!” <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you have done this thing?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Abraham said, “Because I thought, ‘Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for my wife’s sake.’ <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>When God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Abimelech took sheep and cattle, male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife, to him. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you.” <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>To Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are vindicated.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Abraham prayed to God. God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his female servants, and they bore children. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>For Yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.</p>
<p id="21" class="c">21</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Yahweh visited Sarah as he had said, and Yahweh did to Sarah as he had spoken. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Abraham called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.<span class="f">+</span><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Abraham circumcised his son, Isaac, when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Abraham was one hundred years old when his son, Isaac, was born to him. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Sarah said, “God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me.” <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>She said, “Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne him a son in his old age.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>The child grew, and was weaned. Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Therefore she said to Abraham, “Cast out this servant and her son! For the son of this servant will not be heir with my son, Isaac.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>The thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>God said to Abraham, “Don’t let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy, and because of your servant. In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For your offspring<span class="f">+</span> will be named through Isaac. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>I will also make a nation of the son of the servant, because he is your child<span class="f">+</span>.” <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder; and gave her the child, and sent her away. She departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>The water in the bottle was spent, and she put the child under one of the shrubs. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow shot away. For she said, “Don’t let me see the death of the child.” She sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>God heard the voice of the boy.</p>
<p class="p">The angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky, and said to her, “What ails you, Hagar? Don’t be afraid. For God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.
    <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him in your hand. For I will make him a great nation.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. She went, filled the bottle with water, and gave the boy drink. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>God was with the boy, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>At that time, Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, “God is with you in all that you do. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Now, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son. But according to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Abraham said, “I will swear.” <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Abraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Abimelech said, “I don’t know who has done this thing. You didn’t tell me, and I didn’t hear of it until today.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Abraham took sheep and cattle, and gave them to Abimelech. Those two made a covenant. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Abimelech said to Abraham, “What do these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves mean?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>He said, “You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well.” <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>Therefore he called that place Beersheba,<span class="f">+</span> because they both swore an oath there. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and called there on the name of Yahweh, the Everlasting God. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines many days.</p>
<p id="22" class="c">22</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>After these things, God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “Here I am.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>He said, “Now take your son, your only son, whom you love, even Isaac, and go into the land of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go yonder. We will worship, and come back to you.” <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. He took in his hand the fire and the knife. They both went together. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, “My father?”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “Here I am, my son.”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Abraham said, “God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they both went together. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>They came to the place which God had told him of. Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Abraham stretched out his hand, and took the knife to kill his son.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Yahweh’s angel called to him out of the sky, and said, “Abraham, Abraham!”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “Here I am.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>He said, “Don’t lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Abraham called the name of that place Yahweh Will Provide.<span class="f">+</span> As it is said to this day, “On Yahweh’s mountain, it will be provided.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Yahweh’s angel called to Abraham a second time out of the sky, <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>and said, “I have sworn by myself, says Yahweh, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son, <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>that I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your offspring<span class="f">+</span> greatly like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand which is on the seashore. Your offspring<span class="f">+</span> will possess the gate of his enemies. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>All the nations of the earth will be blessed by your offspring,<span class="f">+</span> because you have obeyed my voice.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba. Abraham lived at Beersheba.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>After these things, Abraham was told, “Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children to your brother Nahor: <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.</p>
<p id="23" class="c">23</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Sarah lived one hundred twenty-seven years. This was the length of Sarah’s life. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Sarah died in Kiriath Arba (also called Hebron), in the land of Canaan. Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the children of Heth, saying, <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>“I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>The children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him, <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>“Hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb. Bury your dead.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>He talked with them, saying, “If you agree that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me among you as a possession for a burial place.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth. Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying, <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>“No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>He spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, “But if you will, please hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>“My lord, listen to me. What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver<span class="f">+</span> between me and you? Therefore bury your dead.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Abraham listened to Ephron. Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver,<span class="f">+</span> according to the current merchants’ standard.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all of its borders, were deeded <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>The field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abraham by the children of Heth as a possession for a burial place.</p>
<p id="24" class="c">24</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Abraham was old, and well stricken in age. Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, “Please put your hand under my thigh. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>I will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>But you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>The servant said to him, “What if the woman isn’t willing to follow me to this land? Must I bring your son again to the land you came from?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Abraham said to him, “Beware that you don’t bring my son there again. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Yahweh, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my birth, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, ‘I will give this land to your offspring.<span class="f">+</span> He will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>If the woman isn’t willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this oath to me. Only you shall not bring my son there again.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>The servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>The servant took ten camels, of his master’s camels, and departed, having a variety of good things of his master’s with him. He arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>He said, “Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, please give me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Behold, I am standing by the spring of water. The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Let it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say, ‘Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink,’ and she will say, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink,’—let her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin. No man had known her. She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>The servant ran to meet her, and said, “Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>She said, “Drink, my lord.” She hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him a drink. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will also draw for your camels, until they have finished drinking.” <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>She hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>The man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know whether Yahweh had made his journey prosperous or not. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>As the camels had done drinking, the man took a golden ring of half a shekel<span class="f">+</span> weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold, <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>and said, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father’s house for us to lodge in?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.” <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>She said moreover to him, “We have both straw and feed enough, and room to lodge in.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>The man bowed his head, and worshiped Yahweh. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>He said, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, Yahweh has led me on the way to the house of my master’s relatives.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>The young lady ran, and told her mother’s house about these words. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man, to the spring. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>When he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, “This is what the man said to me,” he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>He said, “Come in, you blessed of Yahweh. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>Food was set before him to eat, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told my message.”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “Speak on.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>He said, “I am Abraham’s servant. <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>Yahweh has blessed my master greatly. He has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys. <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>Sarah, my master’s wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. He has given all that he has to him. <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live, <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>but you shall go to my father’s house, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.’ <span id="39" class="v">39 </span>I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not follow me?’ <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>He said to me, ‘Yahweh, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my relatives, and of my father’s house. <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>Then will you be clear from my oath, when you come to my relatives. If they don’t give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.’ <span id="42" class="v">42 </span>I came today to the spring, and said, ‘Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go— <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>behold, I am standing by this spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden who comes out to draw, to whom I will say, “Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,” <span id="44" class="v">44 </span>and she will tell me, “Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,”—let her be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master’s son.’ <span id="45" class="v">45 </span>Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’ <span id="46" class="v">46 </span>She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.’ So I drank, and she also gave the camels a drink. <span id="47" class="v">47 </span>I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands. <span id="48" class="v">48 </span>I bowed my head, and worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for his son. <span id="49" class="v">49 </span>Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="50" class="v">50 </span>Then Laban and Bethuel answered, “The thing proceeds from Yahweh. We can’t speak to you bad or good. <span id="51" class="v">51 </span>Behold, Rebekah is before you. Take her, and go, and let her be your master’s son’s wife, as Yahweh has spoken.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="52" class="v">52 </span>When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to Yahweh. <span id="53" class="v">53 </span>The servant brought out jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and her mother. <span id="54" class="v">54 </span>They ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and stayed all night. They rose up in the morning, and he said, “Send me away to my master.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="55" class="v">55 </span>Her brother and her mother said, “Let the young lady stay with us a few days, at least ten. After that she will go.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="56" class="v">56 </span>He said to them, “Don’t hinder me, since Yahweh has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="57" class="v">57 </span>They said, “We will call the young lady, and ask her.” <span id="58" class="v">58 </span>They called Rebekah, and said to her, “Will you go with this man?”</p>
<p class="p">She said, “I will go.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="59" class="v">59 </span>They sent away Rebekah, their sister, with her nurse, Abraham’s servant, and his men. <span id="60" class="v">60 </span>They blessed Rebekah, and said to her, “Our sister, may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let your offspring<span class="f">+</span> possess the gate of those who hate them.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="61" class="v">61 </span>Rebekah arose with her ladies. They rode on the camels, and followed the man. The servant took Rebekah, and went his way. <span id="62" class="v">62 </span>Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he lived in the land of the South. <span id="63" class="v">63 </span>Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening. He lifted up his eyes and looked. Behold, there were camels coming. <span id="64" class="v">64 </span>Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel. <span id="65" class="v">65 </span>She said to the servant, “Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us?”</p>
<p class="p">The servant said, “It is my master.”</p>
<p class="p">She took her veil, and covered herself.
    <span id="66" class="v">66 </span>The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. <span id="67" class="v">67 </span>Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. He loved her. Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.</p>
<p id="25" class="c">25</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Jokshan became the father of Sheba, and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>The sons of Midian were: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac, <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>but to the sons of Abraham’s concubines, Abraham gave gifts. He sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived: one hundred seventy-five years. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Abraham gave up his spirit, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre, <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth. Abraham was buried there with Sarah, his wife. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s servant, bore to Abraham. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Mishma, Dumah, Massa, <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments: twelve princes, according to their nations. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>These are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years. He gave up his spirit and died, and was gathered to his people. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived opposite all his relatives.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham became the father of Isaac. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren. Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>The children struggled together within her. She said, “If it is so, why do I live?” She went to inquire of Yahweh. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Yahweh said to her,</p>
<p class="q">“Two nations are in your womb.</p>
<p class="q">Two peoples will be separated from your body.</p>
<p class="q">The one people will be stronger than the other people.</p>
<p class="q">The elder will serve the younger.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me with that same red stew, for I am famished.” Therefore his name was called Edom.<span class="f">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>Jacob said, “First, sell me your birthright.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Esau said, “Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>Jacob said, “Swear to me first.”</p>
<p class="p">He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob.
    <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.</p>
<p id="26" class="c">26</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Yahweh appeared to him, and said, “Don’t go down into Egypt. Live in the land I will tell you about. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Live in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For I will give to you, and to your offspring,<span class="f">+</span> all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>I will multiply your offspring<span class="f">+</span> as the stars of the sky, and will give all these lands to your offspring.<span class="f">+</span> In your offspring<span class="f">+</span> will all the nations of the earth be blessed, <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Isaac lived in Gerar. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>The men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “My wife”, lest, he thought, “the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at.” <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Abimelech called Isaac, and said, “Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, ‘She is my sister?’”</p>
<p class="p">Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die because of her.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, “He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted. Yahweh blessed him. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>The man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied him. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Now all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. He called their names after the names by which his father had called them. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Isaac’s servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” He called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>They dug another well, and they argued over that, also. He called its name Sitnah. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>He left that place, and dug another well. They didn’t argue over that one. He called it Rehoboth. He said, “For now Yahweh has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>He went up from there to Beersheba. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Yahweh appeared to him the same night, and said, “I am the God of Abraham your father. Don’t be afraid, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your offspring<span class="f">+</span> for my servant Abraham’s sake.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>He built an altar there, and called on Yahweh’s name, and pitched his tent there. There Isaac’s servants dug a well.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>They said, “We saw plainly that Yahweh was with you. We said, ‘Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you, <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.’ You are now the blessed of Yahweh.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>He made them a feast, and they ate and drank. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>They rose up some time in the morning, and swore an oath to one another. Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>The same day, Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.” <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>He called it Shibah.<span class="f">+</span> Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba<span class="f">+</span> to this day.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>When Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite. <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>They grieved Isaac’s and Rebekah’s spirits.</p>
<p id="27" class="c">27</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>When Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, “My son?”</p>
<p class="p">He said to him, “Here I am.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>He said, “See now, I am old. I don’t know the day of my death. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, and that my soul may bless you before I die.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, “Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying, <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>‘Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before Yahweh before my death.’ <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Go now to the flock and get me two good young goats from there. I will make them savory food for your father, such as he loves. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>You shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>What if my father touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>His mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get them for me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>He went, and got them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made savory food, such as his father loved. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>She put the skins of the young goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>She gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>He came to his father, and said, “My father?”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done what you asked me to do. Please arise, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “Because Yahweh your God gave me success.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Jacob went near to Isaac his father. He felt him, and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>He didn’t recognize him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother, Esau’s hands. So he blessed him. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>He said, “Are you really my son Esau?”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “I am.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>He said, “Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless you.”</p>
<p class="p">He brought it near to him, and he ate. He brought him wine, and he drank.
    <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>His father Isaac said to him, “Come near now, and kiss me, my son.” <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>He came near, and kissed him. He smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him, and said,</p>
<p class="q">“Behold, the smell of my son</p>
<p class="q2">is as the smell of a field which Yahweh has blessed.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>God give you of the dew of the sky,</p>
<p class="q2">of the fatness of the earth,</p>
<p class="q2">and plenty of grain and new wine.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Let peoples serve you,</p>
<p class="q2">and nations bow down to you.</p>
<p class="q">Be lord over your brothers.</p>
<p class="q2">Let your mother’s sons bow down to you.</p>
<p class="q">Cursed be everyone who curses you.</p>
<p class="q2">Blessed be everyone who blesses you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>He also made savory food, and brought it to his father. He said to his father, “Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that your soul may bless me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Isaac his father said to him, “Who are you?”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>Isaac trembled violently, and said, “Who, then, is he who has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? Yes, he will be blessed.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, my father.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>He said, “Your brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>He said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing.” He said, “Haven’t you reserved a blessing for me?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>Isaac answered Esau, “Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants. I have sustained him with grain and new wine. What then will I do for you, my son?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="38" class="v">38 </span>Esau said to his father, “Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, my father.” Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="39" class="v">39 </span>Isaac his father answered him,</p>
<p class="q">“Behold, of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling,</p>
<p class="q">and of the dew of the sky from above.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="40" class="v">40 </span>By your sword will you live, and you will serve your brother.</p>
<p class="q">It will happen, when you will break loose,</p>
<p class="q">that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="41" class="v">41 </span>Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother Jacob.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="42" class="v">42 </span>The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah. She sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you. <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban, my brother, in Haran. <span id="44" class="v">44 </span>Stay with him a few days, until your brother’s fury turns away; <span id="45" class="v">45 </span>until your brother’s anger turn away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send, and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="46" class="v">46 </span>Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?”</p>
<p id="28" class="c">28</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him, “You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father. Take a wife from there from the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a company of peoples, <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>and give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your offspring<span class="f">+</span> with you, that you may inherit the land where you travel, which God gave to Abraham.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Isaac sent Jacob away. He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, Rebekah’s brother, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan Aram, to take him a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a command, saying, “You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan,” <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan Aram. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn’t please Isaac, his father. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Esau went to Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>He came to a certain place, and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. He took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>He dreamed. Behold, a stairway set upon the earth, and its top reached to heaven. Behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Behold, Yahweh stood above it, and said, “I am Yahweh, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac. The land whereon you lie, to you will I give it, and to your offspring<span class="f">+</span>. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Your offspring<span class="f">+</span> will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. In you and in your offspring<span class="f">+</span> will all the families of the earth be blessed. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Behold, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go, and will bring you again into this land. For I will not leave you, until I have done that which I have spoken of to you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Jacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, “Surely Yahweh is in this place, and I didn’t know it.” <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>He was afraid, and said, “How dreadful is this place! This is none other than God’s house, and this is the gate of heaven.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on its top. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Jacob vowed a vow, saying, “If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and clothing to put on, <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>so that I come again to my father’s house in peace, and Yahweh will be my God, <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, will be God’s house. Of all that you will give me I will surely give a tenth to you.”</p>
<p id="29" class="c">29</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>He looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, behold, three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. The stone on the well’s mouth was large. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>There all the flocks were gathered. They rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well’s mouth in its place. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Jacob said to them, “My relatives, where are you from?”</p>
<p class="p">They said, “We are from Haran.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>He said to them, “Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?”</p>
<p class="p">They said, “We know him.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>He said to them, “Is it well with him?”</p>
<p class="p">They said, “It is well. See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>He said, “Behold, it is still the middle of the day, not time to gather the livestock together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>They said, “We can’t, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well’s mouth. Then we water the sheep.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she kept them. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother, Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebekah’s son. She ran and told her father.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>When Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh.” He stayed with him for a month. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my brother, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Leah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Jacob loved Rachel. He said, “I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Jacob served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>In the evening, he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. He went in to her. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Laban gave Zilpah his servant to his daughter Leah for a servant. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>In the morning, behold, it was Leah! He said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Didn’t I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Laban said, “It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah, his servant, to be her servant. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben. For she said, “Because Yahweh has looked at my affliction; for now my husband will love me.” <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>She conceived again, and bore a son, and said, “Because Yahweh has heard that I am hated, he has therefore given me this son also.” She named him Simeon. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>She conceived again, and bore a son. Said, “Now this time will my husband be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore his name was called Levi. <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, “This time will I praise Yahweh.” Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.</p>
<p id="30" class="c">30</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister. She said to Jacob, “Give me children, or else I will die.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Jacob’s anger burned against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in God’s place, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>She said, “Behold, my maid Bilhah. Go in to her, that she may bear on my knees, and I also may obtain children by her.” <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>She gave him Bilhah her servant as wife, and Jacob went in to her. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Rachel said, “God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son.” Therefore called she his name Dan. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Bilhah, Rachel’s servant, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Rachel said, “I have wrestled with my sister with mighty wrestlings, and have prevailed.” She named him Naphtali.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>When Leah saw that she had finished bearing, she took Zilpah, her servant, and gave her to Jacob as a wife. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Zilpah, Leah’s servant, bore Jacob a son. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Leah said, “How fortunate!” She named him Gad. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Zilpah, Leah’s servant, bore Jacob a second son. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Leah said, “Happy am I, for the daughters will call me happy.” She named him Asher.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother, Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>She said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes, also?”</p>
<p class="p">Rachel said, “Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, “You must come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my son’s mandrakes.”</p>
<p class="p">He lay with her that night.
    <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>God listened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Leah said, “God has given me my hire, because I gave my servant to my husband.” She named him Issachar. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good dowry. Now my husband will live with me, because I have borne him six sons.” She named him Zebulun. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Afterwards, she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>She conceived, bore a son, and said, “God has taken away my reproach.” <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>She named him Joseph,<span class="f">+</span> saying, “May Yahweh add another son to me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>When Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service with which I have served you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Laban said to him, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, stay here, for I have divined that Yahweh has blessed me for your sake.” <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>He said, “Appoint me your wages, and I will give it.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>He said to him, “You know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared with me. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>For it was little which you had before I came, and it has increased to a multitude. Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned. Now when will I provide for my own house also?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>He said, “What shall I give you?”</p>
<p class="p">Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it.
    <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. This will be my hire. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>So my righteousness will answer for me hereafter, when you come concerning my hire that is before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that might be with me, will be considered stolen.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Laban said, “Behold, let it be according to your word.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>That day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons. <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>He set three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, plane tree, peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods. <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>He set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink. <span id="39" class="v">39 </span>The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks produced streaked, speckled, and spotted. <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and didn’t put them into Laban’s flock. <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>Whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, Jacob laid the rods in front of the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods; <span id="42" class="v">42 </span>but when the flock were feeble, he didn’t put them in. So the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s. <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.</p>
<p id="31" class="c">31</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>He heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, “Jacob has taken away all that was our father’s. He has obtained all this wealth from that which was our father’s.” <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Jacob saw the expression on Laban’s face, and, behold, it was not toward him as before. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Yahweh said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers, and to your relatives, and I will be with you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock, <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>and said to them, “I see the expression on your father’s face, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>You know that I have served your father with all of my strength. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God didn’t allow him to hurt me. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>If he said this, ‘The speckled will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore speckled. If he said this, ‘The streaked will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore streaked. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Thus God has taken away your father’s livestock, and given them to me. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>During mating season, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>The angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’ <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>He said, ‘Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Rachel and Leah answered him, “Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house? <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Aren’t we considered as foreigners by him? For he has sold us, and has also used up our money. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>For all the riches which God has taken away from our father, that is ours and our children’s. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels, <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>and he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered, including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim<span class="f">+</span> that were her father’s.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he didn’t tell him that he was running away. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>So he fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>He took his relatives with him, and pursued him seven days’ journey. He overtook him in the mountain of Gilead. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword? <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn’t tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp; <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>and didn’t allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.’ <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father’s house, but why have you stolen my gods?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>Jacob answered Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I said, ‘Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.’ <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Anyone you find your gods with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it.” For Jacob didn’t know that Rachel had stolen them.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>Laban went into Jacob’s tent, into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two female servants; but he didn’t find them. He went out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Now Rachel had taken the teraphim,<span class="f">+</span> put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt around all the tent, but didn’t find them. <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>She said to her father, “Don’t let my lord be angry that I can’t rise up before you; for I’m having my period.” He searched, but didn’t find the teraphim.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>Jacob was angry, and argued with Laban. Jacob answered Laban, “What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me? <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="38" class="v">38 </span>“These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young, and I haven’t eaten the rams of your flocks. <span id="39" class="v">39 </span>That which was torn of animals, I didn’t bring to you. I bore its loss. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>This was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes. <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times. <span id="42" class="v">42 </span>Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="43" class="v">43 </span>Laban answered Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do today to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne? <span id="44" class="v">44 </span>Now come, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be for a witness between me and you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="45" class="v">45 </span>Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. <span id="46" class="v">46 </span>Jacob said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by the heap. <span id="47" class="v">47 </span>Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha,<span class="f">+</span> but Jacob called it Galeed.<span class="f">+</span><span id="48" class="v">48 </span>Laban said, “This heap is witness between me and you today.” Therefore it was named Galeed <span id="49" class="v">49 </span>and Mizpah, for he said, “Yahweh watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another. <span id="50" class="v">50 </span>If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you.” <span id="51" class="v">51 </span>Laban said to Jacob, “See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you. <span id="52" class="v">52 </span>May this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm. <span id="53" class="v">53 </span>The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” Then Jacob swore by the fear of his father, Isaac. <span id="54" class="v">54 </span>Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain. <span id="55" class="v">55 </span>Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. Laban departed and returned to his place.</p>
<p id="32" class="c">32</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>When he saw them, Jacob said, “This is God’s army.” He called the name of that place Mahanaim.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>He commanded them, saying, “This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: ‘This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.’” <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau. Not only that, but he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him.” <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies; <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>and he said, “If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape.” <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh, who said to me, ‘Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good,’ <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I crossed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and strike me, and the mothers with the children. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>You said, ‘I will surely do you good, and make your offspring<span class="f">+</span> as the sand of the sea, which can’t be counted because there are so many.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>He stayed there that night, and took from that which he had with him, a present for Esau, his brother: <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.” <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>He commanded the foremost, saying, “When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, ‘Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?’ <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Then you shall say, ‘They are your servant, Jacob’s. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.’” <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, “This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>You shall say, ‘Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.’” For, he said, “I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>So the present passed over before him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>When he saw that he didn’t prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained, as he wrestled. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>The man said, “Let me go, for the day breaks.”</p>
<p class="p">Jacob said, “I won’t let you go, unless you bless me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>He said to him, “What is your name?”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “Jacob”.
    <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>He said, “Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Jacob asked him, “Please tell me your name.”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “Why is it that you ask what my name is?” He blessed him there.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Jacob called the name of the place Peniel<span class="f">+</span>: for, he said, “I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.” <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Therefore the children of Israel don’t eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.</p>
<p id="33" class="c">33</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two servants. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>He put the servants and their children in front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>He himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, “Who are these with you?”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”
    <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Then the servants came near with their children, and they bowed themselves. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. After them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Esau said, “What do you mean by all this company which I met?”</p>
<p class="p">Jacob said, “To find favor in the sight of my lord.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Jacob said, “Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.” He urged him, and he took it.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Esau said, “Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Esau said, “Let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me.”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “Why? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Jacob traveled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.<span class="f">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan Aram; and encamped before the city. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>He bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for one hundred pieces of money. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>He erected an altar there, and called it El Elohe Israel.<span class="f">+</span></p>
<p id="34" class="c">34</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. He took her, lay with her, and humbled her. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>His soul joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young lady, and spoke kindly to the young lady. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Shechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying, “Get me this young lady as a wife.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the field. Jacob held his peace until they came. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. The men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter; a thing ought not to be done. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Hamor talked with them, saying, “The soul of my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>You shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you. Live and trade in it, and get possessions in it.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you will tell me I will give. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Ask me a great amount for a dowry, and I will give whatever you ask of me, but give me the young lady as a wife.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit, and spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister, <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>and said to them, “We can’t do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised; for that is a reproach to us. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Only on this condition will we consent to you. If you will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised; <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>But if you will not listen to us, to be circumcised, then we will take our sister,<span class="f">+</span> and we will be gone.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>The young man didn’t wait to do this thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter, and he was honored above all the house of his father. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Hamor and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of their city, saying, <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>“These men are peaceful with us. Therefore let them live in the land and trade in it. For behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people, if every male among us is circumcised, as they are circumcised. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Won’t their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours? Only let us give our consent to them, and they will dwell with us.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor, and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>On the third day, when they were sore, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword, came upon the unsuspecting city, and killed all the males. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>They killed Hamor and Shechem, his son, with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went away. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Jacob’s sons came on the dead, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>They took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys, that which was in the city, that which was in the field, <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>and all their wealth. They took captive all their little ones and their wives, and took as plunder everything that was in the house. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number. They will gather themselves together against me and strike me, and I will be destroyed, I and my house.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>They said, “Should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute?”</p>
<p id="35" class="c">35</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there. Make there an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Then Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, change your garments. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Let us arise, and go up to Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me on the way which I went.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>They gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>They traveled, and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them, and they didn’t pursue the sons of Jacob. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>He built an altar there, and called the place El Beth El; because there God was revealed to him, when he fled from the face of his brother. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; and its name was called Allon Bacuth.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan Aram, and blessed him. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>God said to him, “Your name is Jacob. Your name shall not be Jacob any more, but your name will be Israel.” He named him Israel. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>God said to him, “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations will be from you, and kings will come out of your body. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, and to your offspring<span class="f">+</span> after you will I give the land.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him “Bethel”.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>They traveled from Bethel. There was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel travailed. She had hard labor. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>When she was in hard labor, the midwife said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for now you will have another son.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>As her soul was departing (for she died), she named him Benoni,<span class="f">+</span> but his father named him Benjamin.<span class="f">+</span><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem). <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Jacob set up a pillar on her grave. The same is the Pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Israel traveled, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s concubine, and Israel heard of it.</p>
<p class="p">Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.
    <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob’s firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>The sons of Bilhah (Rachel’s servant): Dan and Naphtali. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>The sons of Zilpah (Leah’s servant): Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Jacob came to Isaac his father, to Mamre, to Kiriath Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac lived as foreigners.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>The days of Isaac were one hundred eighty years. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Isaac gave up the spirit, and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. Esau and Jacob, his sons, buried him.</p>
<p id="36" class="c">36</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now this is the history of the generations of Esau (that is, Edom). <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon, the Hittite; and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, the Hivite; <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>and Basemath, Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebaioth. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz. Basemath bore Reuel. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the members of his household, with his livestock, all his animals, and all his possessions, which he had gathered in the land of Canaan, and went into a land away from his brother Jacob. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>For their substance was too great for them to dwell together, and the land of their travels couldn’t bear them because of their livestock. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Esau lived in the hill country of Seir. Esau is Edom.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>This is the history of the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir: <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>these are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz, the son of Adah, the wife of Esau; and Reuel, the son of Basemath, the wife of Esau. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Timna was concubine to Eliphaz, Esau’s son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek. These are the sons of Adah, Esau’s wife. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>These were the sons of Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau’s wife: she bore to Esau Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz, <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek: these are the chiefs who came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>These are the sons of Reuel, Esau’s son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah: these are the chiefs who came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>These are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau’s wife: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah: these are the chiefs who came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau’s wife. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs who came of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>The children of Lotan were Hori and Heman. Lotan’s sister was Timna. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>These are the children of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>These are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the donkeys of Zibeon his father. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>These are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>These are the children of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>These are the children of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>These are the chiefs who came of the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah, <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>chief Dishon, chief Ezer, and chief Dishan: these are the chiefs who came of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom, before any king reigned over the children of Israel. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Bela, the son of Beor, reigned in Edom. The name of his city was Dinhabah. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>Bela died, and Jobab, the son of Zerah of Bozrah, reigned in his place. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place. <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>Husham died, and Hadad, the son of Bedad, who struck Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his place.

<p class="p"><span id="40" class="v">40 </span>These are the names of the chiefs who came from Esau, according to their families, after their places, and by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth, <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon, <span id="42" class="v">42 </span>chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar, <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>chief Magdiel, and chief Iram.

<p id="37" class="c">37</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Jacob lived in the land of his father’s travels, in the land of Canaan. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>This is the history of the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives. Joseph brought an evil report of them to their father. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a coat of many colors. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>His brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, and they hated him, and couldn’t speak peaceably to him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him all the more. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>He said to them, “Please hear this dream which I have dreamed: <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves came around, and bowed down to my sheaf.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>His brothers said to him, “Will you indeed reign over us? Or will you indeed have dominion over us?” They hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>He dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, “Behold, I have dreamed yet another dream: and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.” <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>He told it to his father and to his brothers. His father rebuked him, and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Will I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to you to the earth?” <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>His brothers envied him, but his father kept this saying in mind.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>His brothers went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Israel said to Joseph, “Aren’t your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them.” He said to him, “Here I am.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>He said to him, “Go now, see whether it is well with your brothers, and well with the flock; and bring me word again.” So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>A certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field. The man asked him, “What are you looking for?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>He said, “I am looking for my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are feeding the flock.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>The man said, “They have left here, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’”</p>
<p class="p">Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.
    <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>They said to one another, “Behold, this dreamer comes. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Come now therefore, and let’s kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, ‘An evil animal has devoured him.’ We will see what will become of his dreams.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, “Let’s not take his life.” <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand on him”—that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>When Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him; <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>and they took him, and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty. There was no water in it.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>They sat down to eat bread, and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood? <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Come, and let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites, and not let our hand be on him; for he is our brother, our flesh.” His brothers listened to him. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Midianites who were merchants passed by, and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. They brought Joseph into Egypt.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Reuben returned to the pit; and saw that Joseph wasn’t in the pit; and he tore his clothes. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>He returned to his brothers, and said, “The child is no more; and I, where will I go?” <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>They took Joseph’s coat, and killed a male goat, and dipped the coat in the blood. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>They took the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, “We have found this. Examine it, now, whether it is your son’s coat or not.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>He recognized it, and said, “It is my son’s coat. An evil animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.” <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for his son many days. <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He said, “For I will go down to Sheol<span class="f">+</span> to my son mourning.” His father wept for him. <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>The Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard.</p>
<p id="38" class="c">38</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>At that time, Judah went down from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Judah saw there a certain Canaanite man named Shua’s daughter. He took her, and went in to her. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>She conceived, and bore a son; and he named him Er. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>She conceived again, and bore a son; and she named him Onan. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>She yet again bore a son, and named him Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Judah took a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in Yahweh’s sight. Yahweh killed him. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her, and raise up offspring<span class="f">+</span> for your brother.” <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Onan knew that the offspring<span class="f">+</span> wouldn’t be his; and when he went in to his brother’s wife, he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give offspring<span class="f">+</span> to his brother. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>The thing which he did was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and he killed him also. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your father’s house, until Shelah, my son, is grown up”; for he said, “Lest he also die, like his brothers.” Tamar went and lived in her father’s house.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>After many days, Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died. Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Tamar was told, “Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.” <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>She took off of her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she wasn’t given to him as a wife. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>When Judah saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>He turned to her by the way, and said, “Please come, let me come in to you,” for he didn’t know that she was his daughter-in-law.</p>
<p class="p">She said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>He said, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.”</p>
<p class="p">She said, “Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>He said, “What pledge will I give you?”</p>
<p class="p">She said, “Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.”</p>
<p class="p">He gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.
    <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>She arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand, but he didn’t find her. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Then he asked the men of her place, saying, “Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the road?”</p>
<p class="p">They said, “There has been no prostitute here.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>He returned to Judah, and said, “I haven’t found her; and also the men of the place said, ‘There has been no prostitute here.’” <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Judah said, “Let her keep it, lest we be shamed. Behold, I sent this young goat, and you haven’t found her.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>About three months later, Judah was told, “Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has played the prostitute. Moreover, behold, she is with child by prostitution.”</p>
<p class="p">Judah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burned.”
    <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “By the man, whose these are, I am with child.” She also said, “Please discern whose are these—the signet, and the cords, and the staff.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Judah acknowledged them, and said, “She is more righteous than I, because I didn’t give her to Shelah, my son.”</p>
<p class="p">He knew her again no more.
    <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>In the time of her travail, behold, twins were in her womb. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>When she travailed, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, “This came out first.” <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>As he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out, and she said, “Why have you made a breach for yourself?” Therefore his name was called Perez.<span class="f">+</span><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Afterward his brother came out, that had the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah.<span class="f">+</span></p>
<p id="39" class="c">39</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Joseph was brought down to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Yahweh was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>His master saw that Yahweh was with him, and that Yahweh made all that he did prosper in his hand. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Joseph found favor in his sight. He ministered to him, and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>From the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, Yahweh blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake. Yahweh’s blessing was on all that he had, in the house and in the field. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>He left all that he had in Joseph’s hand. He didn’t concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate.</p>
<p class="p">Joseph was well-built and handsome.
    <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>After these things, his master’s wife set her eyes on Joseph; and she said, “Lie with me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>But he refused, and said to his master’s wife, “Behold, my master doesn’t know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>No one is greater in this house than I am, and he has not kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he didn’t listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>About this time, he went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the house inside. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>She caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me!”</p>
<p class="p">He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside.
    <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had run outside, <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, “Behold, he has brought a Hebrew in to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>When he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.” <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>She spoke to him according to these words, saying, “The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me, <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>and as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>When his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, “This is what your servant did to me,” his wrath was kindled. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>But Yahweh was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for it. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>The keeper of the prison didn’t look after anything that was under his hand, because Yahweh was with him; and that which he did, Yahweh made it prosper.</p>
<p id="40" class="c">40</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>After these things, the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord, the king of Egypt. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cup bearer and the chief baker. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>He put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he took care of them. They stayed in prison many days. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>They both dreamed a dream, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the cup bearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Joseph came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and saw that they were sad. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>He asked Pharaoh’s officers who were with him in custody in his master’s house, saying, “Why do you look so sad today?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>They said to him, “We have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it.”</p>
<p class="p">Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Please tell it to me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>The chief cup bearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream, behold, a vine was in front of me, <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>and in the vine were three branches. It was as though it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters produced ripe grapes. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head, and restore you to your office. You will give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, the way you did when you were his cup bearer. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>But remember me when it will be well with you, and please show kindness to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>For indeed, I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, “I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>In the uppermost basket there were all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation. The three baskets are three days. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you, and will hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you.” <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and he lifted up the head of the chief cup bearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>He restored the chief cup bearer to his position again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand; <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Yet the chief cup bearer didn’t remember Joseph, but forgot him.</p>
<p id="41" class="c">41</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>At the end of two full years, Pharaoh dreamed: and behold, he stood by the river. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, sleek and fat, and they fed in the marsh grass. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Behold, seven other cattle came up after them out of the river, ugly and thin, and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>The ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>He slept and dreamed a second time: and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, healthy and good. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Behold, seven heads of grain, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>In the morning, his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all of Egypt’s magicians and wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Then the chief cup bearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “I remember my faults today. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, with the chief baker. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>We dreamed a dream in one night, he and I. We dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>There was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams. To each man according to his dream he interpreted. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>As he interpreted to us, so it was. He restored me to my office, and he hanged him.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. He shaved himself, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, “It isn’t in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, “In my dream, behold, I stood on the brink of the river: <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>and behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, fat and sleek. They fed in the marsh grass, <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>and behold, seven other cattle came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for ugliness. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>The thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle, <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>and when they had eaten them up, it couldn’t be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ugly, as at the beginning. So I awoke. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good: <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>and behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>The seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good heads of grain are seven years. The dream is one. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>The seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>That is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh. What God is about to do he has shown to Pharaoh. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>There will arise after them seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land, <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very grievous. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>“Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt’s produce in the seven plenteous years. <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>Let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>The food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt; that the land not perish through the famine.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>The thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?” <span id="39" class="v">39 </span>Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Because God has shown you all of this, there is no one so discreet and wise as you. <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>You shall be over my house, and according to your word will all my people be ruled. Only in the throne I will be greater than you.” <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.” <span id="42" class="v">42 </span>Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck, <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had. They cried before him, “Bow the knee!” He set him over all the land of Egypt. <span id="44" class="v">44 </span>Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, and without you shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.” <span id="45" class="v">45 </span>Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-Paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife. Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="46" class="v">46 </span>Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. <span id="47" class="v">47 </span>In the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly. <span id="48" class="v">48 </span>He gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was around every city, he laid up in the same. <span id="49" class="v">49 </span>Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped counting, for it was without number. <span id="50" class="v">50 </span>To Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him. <span id="51" class="v">51 </span>Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh,<span class="f">+</span> “For”, he said, “God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.” <span id="52" class="v">52 </span>The name of the second, he called Ephraim<span class="f">+</span>: “For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="53" class="v">53 </span>The seven years of plenty, that were in the land of Egypt, came to an end. <span id="54" class="v">54 </span>The seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. <span id="55" class="v">55 </span>When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.” <span id="56" class="v">56 </span>The famine was over all the surface of the earth. Joseph opened all the store houses, and sold to the Egyptians. The famine was severe in the land of Egypt. <span id="57" class="v">57 </span>All countries came into Egypt, to Joseph, to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth.</p>
<p id="42" class="c">42</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?” <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>He said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy for us from there, so that we may live, and not die.” <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Joseph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>But Jacob didn’t send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with his brothers; for he said, “Lest perhaps harm happen to him.” <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>The sons of Israel came to buy among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Joseph was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people of the land. Joseph’s brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognized them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with them. He said to them, “Where did you come from?”</p>
<p class="p">They said, “From the land of Canaan to buy food.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Joseph recognized his brothers, but they didn’t recognize him. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them, and said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>They said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>We are all one man’s sons; we are honest men. Your servants are not spies.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>He said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>They said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is today with our father, and one is no more.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Joseph said to them, “It is like I told you, saying, ‘You are spies!’ <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>By this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go out from here, unless your youngest brother comes here. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and you shall be bound, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.” <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>He put them all together into custody for three days.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Joseph said to them the third day, “Do this, and live, for I fear God. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>If you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison; but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Bring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified, and you won’t die.”</p>
<p class="p">They did so.
    <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>They said to one another, “We are certainly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we wouldn’t listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us.” <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Reuben answered them, saying, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘Don’t sin against the child,’ and you wouldn’t listen? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required.” <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>They didn’t know that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>He turned himself away from them, and wept. Then he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain, and to restore each man’s money into his sack, and to give them food for the way. So it was done to them.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>He said to his brothers, “My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!” Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?” <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>They came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened to them, saying, <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>“The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>We said to him, ‘We are honest men. We are no spies. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is today with our father in the land of Canaan.’ <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>The man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>As they emptied their sacks, behold, each man’s bundle of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid. <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>Jacob, their father, said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away. All these things are against me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>Reuben spoke to his father, saying, “Kill my two sons, if I don’t bring him to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="38" class="v">38 </span>He said, “My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm happens to him along the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.”<span class="f">+</span></p>
<p id="43" class="c">43</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The famine was severe in the land. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>When they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little more food.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Judah spoke to him, saying, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’ <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>If you’ll send our brother with us, we’ll go down and buy you food, <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>but if you’ll not send him, we’ll not go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Israel said, “Why did you treat me so badly, telling the man that you had another brother?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>They said, “The man asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ We just answered his questions. Is there any way we could know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down?’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Judah said to Israel, his father, “Send the boy with me, and we’ll get up and go, so that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>I’ll be collateral for him. From my hand will you require him. If I don’t bring him to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever, <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>for if we hadn’t delayed, surely we would have returned a second time by now.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Their father, Israel, said to them, “If it must be so, then do this. Take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a present for the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds; <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>and take double money in your hand, and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Take your brother also, get up, and return to the man. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>May God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>The men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, and butcher an animal, and prepare; for the men will dine with me at noon.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>The man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men to Joseph’s house. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph’s house; and they said, “Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, we’re brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as slaves, along with our donkeys.” <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>They came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house, <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>and said, “Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>When we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and behold, each man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. We have brought it back in our hand. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>We have brought down other money in our hand to buy food. We don’t know who put our money in our sacks.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>He said, “Peace be to you. Don’t be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money.” He brought Simeon out to them. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>The man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. He gave their donkeys fodder. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>They prepared the present for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>When Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves down to him to the earth. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>He asked them of their welfare, and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>They said, “Your servant, our father, is well. He is still alive.” They bowed down humbly. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>He lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother’s son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?” He said, “God be gracious to you, my son.” <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Joseph hurried, for his heart yearned over his brother; and he sought a place to weep. He entered into his room, and wept there. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>He washed his face, and came out. He controlled himself, and said, “Serve the meal.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians, that ate with him, by themselves, because the Egyptians don’t eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth, and the men marveled one with another. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>He sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. They drank, and were merry with him.</p>
<p id="44" class="c">44</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>He commanded the steward of his house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in his sack’s mouth. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, with his grain money.” He did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>When they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, “Up, follow after the men. When you overtake them, ask them, ‘Why have you rewarded evil for good? <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Isn’t this that from which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed divines? You have done evil in so doing.’” <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>He overtook them, and he spoke these words to them.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing! <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan. How then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord’s house? <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s slaves.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>He said, “Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it is found will be my slave; and you will be blameless.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Then they hurried, and each man took his sack down to the ground, and each man opened his sack. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>He searched, beginning with the oldest, and ending at the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Then they tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey, and returned to the city.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, and he was still there. They fell on the ground before him. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Joseph said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Don’t you know that such a man as I can indeed divine?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Judah said, “What will we tell my lord? What will we speak? Or how will we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we are my lord’s slaves, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>He said, “Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he will be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Then Judah came near to him, and said, “Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord’s ears, and don’t let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father, or a brother?’ <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>We said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him.’ <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>You said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.’ <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>We said to my lord, ‘The boy can’t leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’ <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>You said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will see my face no more.’ <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>When we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Our father said, ‘Go again and buy us a little food.’ <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>We said, ‘We can’t go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down: for we may not see the man’s face, unless our youngest brother is with us.’ <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Your servant, my father, said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons: <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>and the one went out from me, and I said, “Surely he is torn in pieces”; and I haven’t seen him since. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.’<span class="f">+</span><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us; since his life is bound up in the boy’s life; <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>it will happen, when he sees that the boy is no more, that he will die. Your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant, our father, with sorrow to Sheol.<span class="f">+</span><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>For your servant became collateral for the boy to my father, saying, ‘If I don’t bring him to you, then I will bear the blame to my father forever.’ <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>Now therefore, please let your servant stay instead of the boy, my lord’s slave; and let the boy go up with his brothers. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>For how will I go up to my father, if the boy isn’t with me?—lest I see the evil that will come on my father.”</p>
<p id="45" class="c">45</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Then Joseph couldn’t control himself before all those who stood before him, and he cried, “Cause everyone to go out from me!” No one else stood with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brothers. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>He wept aloud. The Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Does my father still live?”</p>
<p class="p">His brothers couldn’t answer him; for they were terrified at his presence.
    <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Joseph said to his brothers, “Come near to me, please.”</p>
<p class="p">They came near. “He said, I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.
    <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Now don’t be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are yet five years, in which there will be no plowing and no harvest. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>So now it wasn’t you who sent me here, but God, and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Hurry, and go up to my father, and tell him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says, “God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me. Don’t wait. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you will be near to me, you, your children, your children’s children, your flocks, your herds, and all that you have. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>There I will nourish you; for there are yet five years of famine; lest you come to poverty, you, and your household, and all that you have.”’ <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>You shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. You shall hurry and bring my father down here.” <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>He fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>He kissed all his brothers, and wept on them. After that his brothers talked with him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>The report of it was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, “Joseph’s brothers have come.” It pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this. Load your animals, and go, travel to the land of Canaan. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.’ <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Now you are commanded: do this. Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Also, don’t concern yourselves about your belongings, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>The sons of Israel did so. Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>He gave each one of them changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>He sent the following to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>So he sent his brothers away, and they departed. He said to them, “See that you don’t quarrel on the way.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>They went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>They told him, saying, “Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.” His heart fainted, for he didn’t believe them. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>They told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them. When he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob, their father, revived. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Israel said, “It is enough. Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”</p>
<p id="46" class="c">46</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Israel traveled with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father, Isaac. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, “Jacob, Jacob!”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “Here I am.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>He said, “I am God, the God of your father. Don’t be afraid to go down into Egypt, for there I will make of you a great nation. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>I will go down with you into Egypt. I will also surely bring you up again. Joseph will close your eyes.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Jacob rose up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob, their father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>They took their livestock, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt—Jacob, and all his offspring<span class="f">+</span> with him, <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>his sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and he brought all his offspring<span class="f">+</span> with him into Egypt.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>These are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>The sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Iob, and Shimron. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, with his daughter Dinah. All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty-three. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah their sister. The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah, his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob, even sixteen souls. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>To Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>The son of Dan: Hushim. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel, his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob: all the souls were seven. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>All the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt, who were his direct offspring, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, all the souls were sixty-six. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>The sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, were seventy.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>He sent Judah before him to Joseph, to show the way before him to Goshen, and they came into the land of Goshen. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Joseph prepared his chariot, and went up to meet Israel, his father, in Goshen. He presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father’s house, “I will go up, and speak with Pharaoh, and will tell him, ‘My brothers, and my father’s house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>These men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock, and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.’ <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>It will happen, when Pharaoh summons you, and will say, ‘What is your occupation?’ <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>that you shall say, ‘Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers:’ that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.”</p>

<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, “My father and my brothers, with their flocks, their herds, and all that they own, have come out of the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.” <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>From among his brothers he took five men, and presented them to Pharaoh. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?”</p>
<p class="p">They said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.”
    <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>They said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live as foreigners in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks. For the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, “Your father and your brothers have come to you. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>The land of Egypt is before you. Make your father and your brothers dwell in the best of the land. Let them dwell in the land of Goshen. If you know any able men among them, then put them in charge of my livestock.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Joseph brought in Jacob, his father, and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How many are the days of the years of your life?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred thirty years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.” <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Joseph nourished his father, his brothers, and all of his father’s household, with bread, according to their families.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>There was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, “Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence? For our money fails.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Joseph said, “Give me your livestock; and I will give you food for your livestock, if your money is gone.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>They brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord how our money is all spent, and the herds of livestock are my lord’s. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land won’t be desolate.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every man of the Egyptians sold his field, because the famine was severe on them, and the land became Pharaoh’s. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>As for the people, he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Only he didn’t buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they didn’t sell their land. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>It will happen at the harvests, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed of the field, for your food, for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>They said, “You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone didn’t become Pharaoh’s.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got themselves possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty-seven years. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>The time came near that Israel must die, and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please don’t bury me in Egypt, <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>but when I sleep with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place.”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “I will do as you have said.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>He said, “Swear to me,” and he swore to him. Israel bowed himself on the bed’s head.</p>
<p id="48" class="c">48</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>After these things, someone said to Joseph, “Behold, your father is sick.” He took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Someone told Jacob, and said, “Behold, your son Joseph comes to you,” and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your offspring<span class="f">+</span> after you for an everlasting possession.’ <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Your issue, whom you become the father of after them, will be yours. They will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem).”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Israel saw Joseph’s sons, and said, “Who are these?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.”</p>
<p class="p">He said, “Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.”
    <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he couldn’t see. He brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Israel said to Joseph, “I didn’t think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your offspring<span class="f">+</span> also.” <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near to him. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>He blessed Joseph, and said, “The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has fed me all my life long to this day, <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads, and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac. Let them grow into a multitude upon the earth.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. He held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father; for this is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>His father refused, and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his offspring<span class="f">+</span> will become a multitude of nations.” <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>He blessed them that day, saying, “In you will Israel bless, saying, ‘God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh’” He set Ephraim before Manasseh. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.”</p>
<p id="49" class="c">49</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Jacob called to his sons, and said: “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come.</p>

<p class="nb"></p><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Joseph fell on his father’s face, wept on him, and kissed him. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father; and the physicians embalmed Israel. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Forty days were fulfilled for him, for that is how many the days it takes to embalm. The Egyptians wept for him for seventy days.
  
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>When the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>‘My father made me swear, saying, “Behold, I am dying. Bury me in my grave which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan.” Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come again.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Pharaoh said, “Go up, and bury your father, just like he made you swear.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, all the elders of the land of Egypt, <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>All the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>There went up with him both chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>They came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation. He mourned for his father seven days. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians.” Therefore its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>His sons did to him just as he commanded them, <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burial site, from Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Joseph returned into Egypt—he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us back for all the evil which we did to him.” <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>They sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father commanded before he died, saying, <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>‘You shall tell Joseph, “Now please forgive the disobedience of your brothers, and their sin, because they did evil to you.”’ Now, please forgive the disobedience of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>His brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, “Behold, we are your servants.” <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for am I in the place of God? <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is today, to save many people alive. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Now therefore don’t be afraid. I will nourish you and your little ones.” He comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Joseph lived in Egypt, he, and his father’s house. Joseph lived one hundred ten years. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Joseph saw Ephraim’s children to the third generation. The children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born on Joseph’s knees. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Joseph said to his brothers, “I am dying, but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.” <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.” <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>So Joseph died, being one hundred ten years old, and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</p>
