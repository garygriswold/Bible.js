<p class="mt">Paul’s Letter to Philemon</p>
<p id="1" class="c">1</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house: <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers, <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints; <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate, <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>yet for love’s sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains, Onesimus,<span class="f">+ Onesimus means “useful”.</span><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart, <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever, <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put that to my account. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides). <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
