<p class="mt">The Letter from James</p>
<p id="1" class="c">1</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion: Greetings. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Count it all joy, my brothers,<span class="f">+</span> when you fall into various temptations, <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Let endurance have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach; and it will be given to him. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>For that man shouldn’t think that he will receive anything from the Lord. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>But let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position; <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>and the rich, in that he is made humble, because like the flower in the grass, he will pass away. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>For the sun arises with the scorching wind, and withers the grass, and the flower in it falls, and the beauty of its appearance perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in his pursuits.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Blessed is the man who endures temptation, for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to those who love him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Let no man say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God,” for God can’t be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Then the lust, when it has conceived, bears sin; and the sin, when it is full grown, produces death. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Don’t be deceived, my beloved brothers. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, nor turning shadow. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Of his own will he gave birth to us by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>So, then, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger; <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>for the anger of man doesn’t produce the righteousness of God. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Therefore, putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with humility the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.<span class="f">+</span><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>But be doers of the word, and not only hearers, deluding your own selves. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror; <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>for he sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>But he who looks into the perfect law of freedom, and continues, not being a hearer who forgets, but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>If anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he doesn’t bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this man’s religion is worthless. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.</p>
<p id="2" class="c">2</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>My brothers, don’t hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with partiality. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>For if a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, comes into your synagogue,<span class="f">+</span> and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in; <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing, and say, “Sit here in a good place”; and you tell the poor man, “Stand there,” or “Sit by my footstool”; <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>haven’t you shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts? <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Listen, my beloved brothers. Didn’t God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him? <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>But you have dishonored the poor man. Don’t the rich oppress you, and personally drag you before the courts? <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Don’t they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called? <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>However, if you fulfill the royal law, according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,”<span class="x">+</span> you do well. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>But if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,”<span class="x">+</span> also said, “Do not commit murder.”<span class="x">+</span> Now if you do not commit adultery, but murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>So speak, and so do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works? Can faith save him? <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food, <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>and one of you tells them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled”; and yet you didn’t give them the things the body needs, what good is it? <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Yes, a man will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without works, and I by my works will show you my faith.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe, and shudder. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>But do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead? <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Wasn’t Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected; <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness”;<span class="x">+</span> and he was called the friend of God. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>You see then that by works, a man is justified, and not only by faith. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>In the same way, wasn’t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way? <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.</p>
<p id="3" class="c">3</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>For in many things we all stumble. If anyone doesn’t stumble in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Indeed, we put bits into the horses’ mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Behold,<span class="f">+</span> the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest! <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>And the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna.<span class="f">+</span><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and sea creature, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind; <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>but nobody can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of God. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Out of the same mouth comes blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water? <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, don’t boast and don’t lie against the truth. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.</p>
<p id="4" class="c">4</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Don’t they come from your pleasures that war in your members? <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>You lust, and don’t have. You murder and covet, and can’t obtain. You fight and make war. You don’t have, because you don’t ask. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>You ask, and don’t receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>You adulterers and adulteresses, don’t you know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously”? <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”<span class="x">+</span><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Be subject therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Don’t speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge another?</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow let’s go into this city, and spend a year there, trade, and make a profit.” <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Whereas you don’t know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life? For you are a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>For you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that.” <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>But now you glory in your boasting. All such boasting is evil. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>To him therefore who knows to do good, and doesn’t do it, to him it is sin.</p>
<p id="5" class="c">5</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming on you. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth-eaten. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Your gold and your silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you, and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up your treasure in the last days. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you have kept back by fraud, cry out, and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Armies.<span class="f">+</span><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>You have lived delicately on the earth, and taken your pleasure. You have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>You have condemned, you have murdered the righteous one. He doesn’t resist you.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Be patient therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receives the early and late rain. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Don’t grumble, brothers, against one another, so that you won’t be judged. Behold, the judge stands at the door. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Take, brothers, for an example of suffering and of perseverance, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Behold, we call them blessed who endured. You have heard of the perseverance of Job, and have seen the Lord in the outcome, and how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>But above all things, my brothers, don’t swear— not by heaven, or by the earth, or by any other oath; but let your “yes” be “yes”, and your “no”, “no”; so that you don’t fall into hypocrisy.<span class="f">+</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Is any among you suffering? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing praises. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord, <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>and the prayer of faith will heal him who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. If he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Confess your offenses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The insistent prayer of a righteous person is powerfully effective. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it didn’t rain on the earth for three years and six months. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>He prayed again, and the sky gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Brothers, if any among you wanders from the truth and someone turns him back, <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.</p>
