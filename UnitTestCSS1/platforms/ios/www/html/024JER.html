<p class="mt2">The Book of</p>
<p class="mt">Jeremiah</p>
<p id="1" class="c">1</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, one of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Yahweh’s word<span class="f">+ “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.</span> came to him in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Now Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>“Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.</p>
<p class="q2">Before you were born, I sanctified you.</p>
<p class="q2">I have appointed you a prophet to the nations.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Then I said, “Ah, Lord<span class="f">+ The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”</span>  Yahweh! Behold,<span class="f">+ “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span> I don’t know how to speak; for I am a child.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>But Yahweh said to me, “Don’t say, ‘I am a child;’ for you must go to whomever I send you, and you must say whatever I command you. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Don’t be afraid because of them, for I am with you to rescue you,” says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Then Yahweh stretched out his hand, and touched my mouth. Then Yahweh said to me, “Behold, I have put my words in your mouth. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Behold, I have today set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to uproot and to tear down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, “Jeremiah, what do you see?”</p>
<p class="p">I said, “I see a branch of an almond tree.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Then Yahweh said to me, “You have seen well; for I watch over my word to perform it.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Yahweh’s word came to me the second time, saying, “What do you see?”</p>
<p class="p">I said, “I see a boiling cauldron; and it is tipping away from the north.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Then Yahweh said to me, “Out of the north, evil will break out on all the inhabitants of the land. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north,” says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="q">“They will come, and they will each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="q2">and against all its walls all around, and against all the cities of Judah.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>I will utter my judgments against them concerning all their wickedness,</p>
<p class="q2">in that they have forsaken me,</p>
<p class="q2">and have burned incense to other gods,</p>
<p class="q2">and worshiped the works of their own hands.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>“You therefore put your belt on your waist, arise, and say to them all that I command you. Don’t be dismayed at them, lest I dismay you before them. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>For, behold, I have made you today a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>They will fight against you, but they will not prevail against you; for I am with you”, says Yahweh, “to rescue you.”</p>
<p id="2" class="c">2</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Go, and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Yahweh says,</p>
<p class="q">“I remember for you the kindness of your youth,</p>
<p class="q2">the love of your weddings;</p>
<p class="q">how you went after me in the wilderness,</p>
<p class="q2">in a land that was not sown.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Israel was holiness to Yahweh,</p>
<p class="q2">the first fruits of his increase.</p>
<p class="q">All who devour him will be held guilty.</p>
<p class="q2">Evil will come on them,”’ says Yahweh.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Hear Yahweh’s word, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel! <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Yahweh says,</p>
<p class="q">“What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me,</p>
<p class="q2">that they have gone far from me,</p>
<p class="q">and have walked after worthless vanity,</p>
<p class="q2">and have become worthless?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>They didn’t say, ‘Where is Yahweh who brought us up out of the land of Egypt,</p>
<p class="q2">who led us through the wilderness,</p>
<p class="q2">through a land of deserts and of pits,</p>
<p class="q2">through a land of drought and of the shadow of death,</p>
<p class="q2">through a land that no one passed through,</p>
<p class="q2">and where no man lived?’</p>
<p class="q"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>I brought you into a plentiful land,</p>
<p class="q2">to eat its fruit and its goodness;</p>
<p class="q">but when you entered, you defiled my land,</p>
<p class="q2">and made my heritage an abomination.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>The priests didn’t say, ‘Where is Yahweh?’</p>
<p class="q2">and those who handle the law didn’t know me.</p>
<p class="q">The rulers also transgressed against me,</p>
<p class="q2">and the prophets prophesied by Baal,</p>
<p class="q2">and followed things that do not profit.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>“Therefore I will yet contend with you,” says Yahweh,</p>
<p class="q2">“and I will contend with your children’s children.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>For pass over to the islands of Kittim, and see;</p>
<p class="q2">and send to Kedar, and consider diligently;</p>
<p class="q2">and see if there has been such a thing.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Has a nation changed its gods,</p>
<p class="q2">which really are no gods?</p>
<p class="q2">But my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>“Be astonished, you heavens, at this,</p>
<p class="q2">and be horribly afraid.</p>
<p class="q2">Be very desolate,” says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>“For my people have committed two evils:</p>
<p class="q2">they have forsaken me, the spring of living waters,</p>
<p class="q2">and cut them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Is Israel a slave?</p>
<p class="q2">Is he born into slavery?</p>
<p class="q2">Why has he become a captive?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>The young lions have roared at him, and yelled.</p>
<p class="q2">They have made his land waste.</p>
<p class="q2">His cities are burned up, without inhabitant.</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>“Haven’t you brought this on yourself,</p>
<p class="q2">in that you have forsaken Yahweh your God,<span class="f">+ The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</span> when he led you by the way?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Now what do you gain by going to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor?</p>
<p class="q2">Or why do you to go on the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?<span class="f">+ i.e., the Euphrates River</span></p>
<p class="q"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>“Your own wickedness will correct you,</p>
<p class="q2">and your backsliding will rebuke you.</p>
<p class="q">Know therefore and see that it is an evil and bitter thing,</p>
<p class="q2">that you have forsaken Yahweh your God,</p>
<p class="q2">and that my fear is not in you,” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>“For long ago I broke off your yoke,</p>
<p class="q2">and burst your bonds.</p>
<p class="q">You said, ‘I will not serve;’</p>
<p class="q2">for on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed yourself,</p>
<p class="q2">playing the prostitute.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Yet I had planted you a noble vine,</p>
<p class="q2">a pure and faithful seed.</p>
<p class="q2">How then have you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>For though you wash yourself with lye,</p>
<p class="q2">and use much soap,</p>
<p class="q2">yet your iniquity is marked before me,” says the Lord Yahweh.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>“How can you say, ‘I am not defiled.</p>
<p class="q2">I have not gone after the Baals’?</p>
<p class="q">See your way in the valley.</p>
<p class="q2">Know what you have done.</p>
<p class="q">You are a swift dromedary traversing her ways;
    <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that sniffs the wind in her craving.</p>
<p class="q2">When she is in heat, who can turn her away?</p>
<p class="q2">All those who seek her will not weary themselves. In her month, they will find her.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>“Keep your feet from being bare,</p>
<p class="q2">and your throat from thirst.</p>
<p class="q">But you said, ‘It is in vain.</p>
<p class="q2">No, for I have loved strangers,</p>
<p class="q2">and I will go after them.’</p>
<p class="q"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>As the thief is ashamed when he is found,</p>
<p class="q2">so is the house of Israel ashamed;</p>
<p class="q2">they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>who tell wood, ‘You are my father;’</p>
<p class="q2">and a stone, ‘You have given birth to me:’</p>
<p class="q">for they have turned their back to me,</p>
<p class="q2">and not their face;</p>
<p class="q2">but in the time of their trouble they will say, ‘Arise, and save us.’</p>
<p class="q"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>“But where are your gods that you have made for yourselves?</p>
<p class="q2">Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble:</p>
<p class="q2">for you have as many gods as you have towns, O Judah.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>“Why will you contend with me?</p>
<p class="q2">You all have transgressed against me,” says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>“I have struck your children in vain.</p>
<p class="q2">They received no correction.</p>
<p class="q">Your own sword has devoured your prophets,</p>
<p class="q2">like a destroying lion.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>Generation, consider Yahweh’s word.</p>
<p class="q2">Have I been a wilderness to Israel?</p>
<p class="q2">Or a land of thick darkness?</p>
<p class="q">Why do my people say, ‘We have broken loose.</p>
<p class="q2">We will come to you no more?’</p>
<p class="q"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>“Can a virgin forget her ornaments,</p>
<p class="q2">or a bride her attire?</p>
<p class="q2">Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>How well you prepare your way to seek love!</p>
<p class="q2">Therefore you have even taught the wicked women your ways.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor is found in your skirts.</p>
<p class="q2">You did not find them breaking in;</p>
<p class="q2">but it is because of all these things.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>“Yet you said, ‘I am innocent.</p>
<p class="q2">Surely his anger has turned away from me.’</p>
<p class="q">“Behold, I will judge you,</p>
<p class="q2">because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’</p>
<p class="q"><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>Why do you go about so much to change your ways?</p>
<p class="q2">You will be ashamed of Egypt also,</p>
<p class="q2">as you were ashamed of Assyria.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>You will also leave that place with your hands on your head;</p>
<p class="q2">for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust,</p>
<p class="q2">and you won’t prosper with them.</p>
<p id="3" class="c">3</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>“They say, ‘If a man puts away his wife, and she goes from him, and becomes another man’s, should he return to her again?’ Wouldn’t that land be greatly polluted? But you have played the prostitute with many lovers; yet return again to me,” says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see! Where have you not been lain with? You have sat waiting for them by the road, as an Arabian in the wilderness. You have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your wickedness. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; yet you have had a prostitute’s forehead. You refused to be ashamed. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Will you not from this time cry to me, ‘My Father, you are the guide of my youth?’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>“‘Will he retain his anger forever? Will he keep it to the end?’ Behold, you have spoken and have done evil things, and have had your way.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Moreover, Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah the king, “Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and has played the prostitute there. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>I said after she had done all these things, ‘She will return to me;’ but she didn’t return; and her treacherous sister Judah saw it. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>I saw when, for this very cause, that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce, yet treacherous Judah, her sister, had no fear; but she also went and played the prostitute. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Because she took her prostitution lightly, the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with wood. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Yet for all this her treacherous sister, Judah, has not returned to me with her whole heart, but only in pretense,” says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Yahweh said to me, “Backsliding Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, ‘Return, you backsliding Israel,’ says Yahweh; ‘I will not look in anger on you; for I am merciful,’ says Yahweh. ‘I will not keep anger forever. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against Yahweh your God, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed my voice,’ says Yahweh.” <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>“Return, backsliding children,” says Yahweh; “for I am a husband to you. I will take one of you from a city, and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>It will come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days,” says Yahweh, “they will no longer say, ‘the ark of Yahweh’s covenant!’ It will not come to mind. They won’t remember it. They won’t miss it, nor will another be made. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>At that time they will call Jerusalem ‘Yahweh’s Throne;’ and all the nations will be gathered to it, to Yahweh’s name, to Jerusalem. They will no longer walk after the stubbornness of their evil heart. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>“But I said, ‘How I desire to put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the armies of the nations!’ and I said, ‘You shall call me “My Father”, and shall not turn away from following me.’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>“Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so you have dealt treacherously with me, house of Israel,” says Yahweh. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping and the petitions of the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Yahweh their God. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Return, you backsliding children, and I will heal your backsliding.</p>
<p class="p">“Behold, we have come to you; for you are Yahweh our God.
    <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Truly in vain is help from the hills, the tumult on the mountains. Truly the salvation of Israel is in Yahweh our God. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against Yahweh our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day. We have not obeyed Yahweh our God’s voice.”</p>
<p id="4" class="c">4</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>“If you will return, Israel,” says Yahweh, “if you will return to me, and if you will put away your abominations out of my sight; then you will not be removed; <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>and you will swear, ‘As Yahweh lives,’ in truth, in justice, and in righteousness. The nations will bless themselves in him, and they will glory in him.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>For Yahweh says to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, “Break up your fallow ground, and don’t sow among thorns. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Circumcise yourselves to Yahweh, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go out like fire, and burn so that no one can quench it, because of the evil of your doings. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Declare in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, ‘Blow the trumpet in the land!’ Cry aloud and say, ‘Assemble yourselves! Let us go into the fortified cities!’ <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Set up a standard toward Zion. Flee for safety! Don’t wait; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>A lion has gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations. He is on his way. He has gone out from his place, to make your land desolate, that your cities be laid waste, without inhabitant. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>For this, clothe yourself with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of Yahweh hasn’t turned back from us. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>“It will happen at that day,” says Yahweh, “that the heart of the king will perish, along with the heart of the princes. The priests will be astonished, and the prophets will wonder.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh! Surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, ‘You will have peace;’ whereas the sword reaches to the heart.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse; <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>a full wind from these will come for me. Now I will also utter judgments against them.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Behold, he will come up as clouds, and his chariots will be as the whirlwind. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! For we are ruined. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long will your evil thoughts lodge within you? <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes evil from the hills of Ephraim: <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>“Tell the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, ‘Watchers come from a far country, and raise their voice against the cities of Judah. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>As keepers of a field, they are against her all around, because she has been rebellious against me,’” says Yahweh. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>“Your way and your doings have brought these things to you. This is your wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reaches to your heart.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart! My heart trembles within me. I can’t hold my peace, because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Destruction on destruction is decreed, for the whole land is laid waste. Suddenly my tents are destroyed, and my curtains gone in a moment. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>How long will I see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet?</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>“For my people are foolish. They don’t know me. They are foolish children, and they have no understanding. They are skillful in doing evil, but they don’t know how to do good.” <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>I saw the earth, and, behold, it was waste and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>I saw the mountains, and behold, they trembled, and all the hills moved back and forth. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>I saw, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the sky had fled. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>I saw, and behold, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of Yahweh, before his fierce anger. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>For Yahweh says, “The whole land will be a desolation; yet will I not make a full end. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>For this the earth will mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it. I have planned it, and I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers. They go into the thickets, and climb up on the rocks. Every city is forsaken, and not a man dwells therein. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>You, when you are made desolate, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with scarlet, though you deck yourself with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with makeup, you make yourself beautiful in vain. Your lovers despise you. They seek your life. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her who gives birth to her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, who gasps for breath, who spreads her hands, saying, “Woe is me now! For my soul faints before the murderers.”</p>
<p id="5" class="c">5</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>“Run back and forth through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in its wide places, if you can find a man, if there is anyone who does justly, who seeks truth, then I will pardon her. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Though they say, ‘As Yahweh lives,’ surely they swear falsely.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>O Yahweh, don’t your eyes look on truth? You have stricken them, but they were not grieved. You have consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction. They have made their faces harder than a rock. They have refused to return.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Then I said, “Surely these are poor. They are foolish; for they don’t know the way of Yahweh, nor the law of their God. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>I will go to the great men, and will speak to them; for they know the way of Yahweh, and the law of their God.” But these with one accord have broken the yoke, and burst the bonds. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Therefore a lion out of the forest will kill them, a wolf of the evenings will destroy them, a leopard will watch against their cities. Everyone who goes out there will be torn in pieces, because their transgressions are many, and their backsliding has increased.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>“How can I pardon you? Your children have forsaken me, and sworn by what are no gods. When I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops at the prostitutes’ houses. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>They were as fed horses roaming at large. Everyone neighed after his neighbor’s wife. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Shouldn’t I punish them for these things?” says Yahweh. “Shouldn’t my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>“Go up on her walls, and destroy; but don’t make a full end. Take away her branches, for they are not Yahweh’s. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me,” says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>They have denied Yahweh, and said, “It is not he. Evil will won’t come on us. We won’t see sword or famine. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>The prophets will become wind, and the word is not in them. Thus it will be done to them.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Therefore Yahweh, the God of Armies says, “Because you speak this word, behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it will devour them. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Behold, I will bring a nation on you from far away, house of Israel,” says Yahweh. “It is a mighty nation. It is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you don’t know and don’t understand what they say. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Their quiver is an open tomb. They are all mighty men. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>They will eat up your harvest and your bread, which your sons and your daughters should eat. They will eat up your flocks and your herds. They will eat up your vines and your fig trees. They will beat down your fortified cities in which you trust with the sword.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>“But even in those days,” says Yahweh, “I will not make a full end of you. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>It will happen, when you say, ‘Why has Yahweh our God done all these things to us?’ Then you shall say to them, ‘Just as you have forsaken me, and served foreign gods in your land, so you will serve strangers in a land that is not yours.’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>“Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying, <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>‘Hear this now, foolish people without understanding; who have eyes, and don’t see; who have ears, and don’t hear: <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Don’t you fear me?’ says Yahweh ‘Won’t you tremble at my presence, who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetual decree, that it can’t pass it? Though its waves toss themselves, yet they can’t prevail. Though they roar, they still can’t pass over it.’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>“But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart. They have revolted and gone. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>They don’t say in their heart, ‘Let us now fear Yahweh our God, who gives rain, both the former and the latter, in its season; who preserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest.’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>“Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withheld good from you. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>For among my people are found wicked men. They watch, as fowlers lie in wait. They set a trap. They catch men. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit. Therefore they have become great, and grew rich. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>They have grown fat. They shine; yes, they excel in deeds of wickedness. They don’t plead the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they may prosper; and they don’t judge the right of the needy.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>“Shouldn’t I punish for these things?” says Yahweh. “Shouldn’t my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>“An astonishing and horrible thing has happened in the land. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule by their own authority; and my people love to have it so. What will you do in the end of it?</p>

<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>“Flee for safety, you children of Benjamin, out of the middle of Jerusalem!

<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>“Prepare war against her! Arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us!

Violence and destruction is heard in her.

<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Yahweh of Armies says, “They will thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel like a vine. Turn again your hand as a grape gatherer into the baskets.”</p>

<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>“But go now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Now, because you have done all these works,” says Yahweh, “and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you didn’t hear; and I called you, but you didn’t answer; <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>therefore I will do to the house which is called by my name, in which you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, even the whole offspring<span class="f">+ or, seed</span> of Ephraim.</p>

<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Behold, my anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place, on man, on animal, on the trees of the field, and on the fruit of the ground; and it will burn and will not be quenched.”</p>

<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>“For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight,” says Yahweh. “They have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I didn’t command, nor did it come into my mind. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Therefore behold, the days come”, says Yahweh, “that it will no more be called ‘Topheth’ or ‘The valley of the son of Hinnom’, but ‘The valley of Slaughter’; for they will bury in Topheth until there is no place to bury. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky, and for the animals of the earth.

<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Yahweh says, “Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein, <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baals, which their fathers taught them.” <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Therefore Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, “Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Yahweh of Armies says,</p>
<p class="q">“Consider, and call for the mourning women, that they may come;</p>
<p class="q2">and send for the skillful women, that they may come.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Let them make haste,</p>
<p class="q2">and take up a wailing for us,</p>
<p class="q">that our eyes may run down with tears,</p>
<p class="q2">and our eyelids gush out with waters.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion,</p>
<p class="q2">‘How we are ruined!</p>
<p class="q">We are greatly confounded,</p>
<p class="q2">because we have forsaken the land,</p>
<p class="q2">because they have cast down our dwellings.’”</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Yet hear Yahweh’s word, you women.</p>
<p class="q2">Let your ear receive the word of his mouth.</p>
<p class="q">Teach your daughters wailing,</p>
<p class="q2">and everyone her neighbor lamentation.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>For death has come up into our windows.</p>
<p class="q2">It has entered into our palaces</p>
<p class="q">to cut off the children from outside,</p>
<p class="q2">and the young men from the streets.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Speak, “Yahweh says,</p>
<p class="q">“‘The dead bodies of men will fall as dung on the open field,</p>
<p class="q2">and as the handful after the harvester;</p>
<p class="q2">and no one will gather them.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Yahweh says,</p>
<p class="q">“Don’t let the wise man glory in his wisdom.</p>
<p class="q2">Don’t let the mighty man glory in his might.</p>
<p class="q2">Don’t let the rich man glory in his riches.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>But let him who glories glory in this,</p>
<p class="q2">that he has understanding, and knows me,</p>
<p class="q">that I am Yahweh who exercises loving kindness, justice, and righteousness, in the earth;</p>
<p class="q2">for I delight in these things,” says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>“Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that I will punish all those who are circumcised only in their flesh: <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Egypt, Judah, Edom, the children of Ammon, Moab, and all who have the corners of their hair cut off, who dwell in the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.”</p>
<p id="10" class="c">10</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Hear the word which Yahweh speaks to you, house of Israel! <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Yahweh says,</p>
<p class="q">“Don’t learn the way of the nations,</p>
<p class="q2">and don’t be dismayed at the signs of the sky;</p>
<p class="q2">for the nations are dismayed at them.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>For the customs of the peoples are vanity;</p>

<p class="q2">They fasten it with nails and with hammers,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>They are like a palm tree, of turned work,</p>

<p class="q">They must be carried,</p>

<p class="q">Don’t be afraid of them;</p>

<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>There is no one like you, Yahweh.</p>

<p class="q">Their clothing is blue and purple.</p>
<p class="q2">They are all the work of skillful men.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>But Yahweh is the true God.</p>
<p class="q2">He is the living God,</p>

<p class="q2">The nations aren’t able to withstand his indignation.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>“You shall say this to them: ‘The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.’”</p>
<p class="q"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>God has made the earth by his power.</p>

<p class="q"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Every man has become brutish and without knowledge.</p>
<p class="q2">Every goldsmith is disappointed by his engraved image;</p>

<p class="q"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>They are vanity, a work of delusion.</p>

<p id="11" class="c">11</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>and say to them, Yahweh, the God of Israel says: ‘Cursed is the man who doesn’t hear the words of this covenant, <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace,’ saying, ‘Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you; so you shall be my people, and I will be your God; <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>that I may establish the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey,’ as it is today.”</p>
<p class="p">Then answered I, and said, “Amen, Yahweh.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Yahweh said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Hear the words of this covenant, and do them. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, “Obey my voice.” <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Yet they didn’t obey, nor turn their ear, but everyone walked in the stubbornness of their evil heart. Therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they didn’t do them.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Yahweh said to me, “A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words. They have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Therefore Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will bring evil on them, which they will not be able to escape; and they will cry to me, but I will not listen to them. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense, but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>For according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>“Therefore don’t pray for this people. Don’t lift up cry or prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>What has my beloved to do in my house,</p>

<p class="q2">then you rejoice.”</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Yahweh called your name, “A green olive tree,</p>

<p class="q">With the noise of a great roar he has kindled fire on it,</p>
<p class="q2">and its branches are broken.</p>
<p class="m"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>For Yahweh of Armies, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you, because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done to themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Yahweh gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it. Then you showed me their doings. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter. I didn’t know that they had devised plans against me, saying,</p>
<p class="q">“Let us destroy the tree with its fruit,</p>

<p class="q2">that his name may be no more remembered.”</p>
<p class="q"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>But, Yahweh of Armies, who judges righteously,</p>

<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as Yahweh commanded me.</p>

<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and took the belt from the place where I had hidden it; and behold, the belt was ruined. It was profitable for nothing.</p>

<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Why should you be like a scared man,</p>

<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Yahweh said to me, “Don’t pray for this people for their good. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and meal offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh! Behold, the prophets tell them, ‘You will not see the sword, neither will you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Then Yahweh said to me, “The prophets prophesy lies in my name. I didn’t send them. I didn’t command them. I didn’t speak to them.

<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>“I will appoint over them four kinds,” says Yahweh: “the sword to kill, the dogs to tear, the birds of the sky, and the animals of the earth, to devour and to destroy. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>I will cause them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>For Yahweh says, “Don’t enter into the house of mourning. Don’t go to lament.

<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>“You shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to drink.” <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: “Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>It will happen, when you tell this people all these words, and they ask you, ‘Why has Yahweh pronounced all this great evil against us?’ or ‘What is our iniquity? or ‘What is our sin that we have committed against Yahweh our God?’ <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>then you shall tell them, ‘Because your fathers have forsaken me,’ says Yahweh, ‘and have walked after other gods, have served them, have worshiped them, have forsaken me, and have not kept my law. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>You have done evil more than your fathers, for behold, you each walk after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so that you don’t listen to me. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Therefore will I cast you out of this land into the land that you have not known, neither you nor your fathers.

<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>“Therefore behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that it will no more be said, ‘As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;’ <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>but, ‘As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the countries where he had driven them.’ I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their fathers.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>“Behold, I will send for many fishermen,” says Yahweh, “and they will fish them up.

<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause you to hear my words.”</p>

<p class="q2">They have burned incense to false gods.</p>
<p class="q">They have been made to stumble in their ways,</p>
<p class="q2">in the ancient paths,</p>
<p class="q2">to walk in byways, in a way not built up;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>to make their land an astonishment,</p>

<p class="q">Everyone who passes thereby will be astonished,</p>
<p class="q2">and shake his head.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy.</p>
<p class="q2">I will show them the back, and not the face,</p>
<p class="q2">in the day of their calamity.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Then they said, “Come, and let us devise plans against Jeremiah; for the law won’t perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet.

<p id="19" class="c">19</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Thus said Yahweh, “Go, and buy a potter’s earthen bottle, and take some of the elders of the people, and of the elders of the priests; <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>and go out to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words that I will tell you. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Say, ‘Hear Yahweh’s word, kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem: Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says, “Behold, I will bring evil on this place, which whoever hears, his ears will tingle. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Because they have forsaken me, and have defiled this place, and have burned incense in it to other gods, that they didn’t know, they and their fathers and the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents, <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons in the fire for burnt offerings to Baal; which I didn’t command, nor speak, which didn’t even enter into my mind: <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>therefore, behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that this place will no more be called ‘Topheth’, nor ‘The Valley of the son of Hinnom’, but ‘The valley of Slaughter’.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>“‘“I will make the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem void in this place. I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. I will give their dead bodies to be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>I will make this city an astonishment and a hissing. Everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters. They will each eat the flesh of his friend in the siege and in the distress, with which their enemies, and those who seek their life, will distress them.”’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>“Then you shall break the bottle in the sight of the men who go with you, <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>and shall tell them, ‘Yahweh of Armies says: “Even so I will break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter’s vessel, that can’t be made whole again. They will bury in Topheth, until there is no place to bury. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Thus will I do to this place,” says Yahweh, “and to its inhabitants, even making this city as Topheth. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>The houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, will be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the army of the sky, and have poured out drink offerings to other gods.”’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of Yahweh’s house, and said to all the people: <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>“Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says, ‘Behold, I will bring on this city and on all its towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have made their neck stiff, that they may not hear my words.’”</p>
<p id="20" class="c">20</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in Yahweh’s house, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in Yahweh’s house. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>On the next day, Pashhur released Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, “Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur, but Magormissabib.<span class="f">+ “Magormissabib” means “surrounded by terror”</span><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>For Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends.

I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will carry them captive to Babylon, and will kill them with the sword. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all its gains, and all its precious things, yes, I will give all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies. They will make them captives, take them, and carry them to Babylon. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>You, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house will go into captivity.

<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Yahweh, you have persuaded me, and I was persuaded.</p>
<p class="q2">You are stronger than I, and have prevailed.</p>
<p class="q">I have become a laughing-stock all day.</p>
<p class="q2">Everyone mocks me.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>For as often as I speak, I cry out;</p>
<p class="q2">I cry, “Violence and destruction!”</p>
<p class="q">because Yahweh’s word has been made a reproach to me,</p>
<p class="q2">and a derision, all day.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>If I say, I will not make mention of him,</p>
<p class="q2">or speak any more in his name,</p>
<p class="q">then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones,</p>
<p class="q2">and I am weary with holding it in,</p>
<p class="q2">and I can’t.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>For I have heard the defaming of many,</p>

<p class="q2">those who watch for my fall.</p>
<p class="q">“Perhaps he will be persuaded,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>But Yahweh is with me as an awesome mighty one.</p>
<p class="q2">Therefore my persecutors will stumble,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>But, Yahweh of Armies, who tests the righteous,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Sing to Yahweh!</p>
<p class="q2">Praise Yahweh,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Cursed is the day in which I was born.</p>
<p class="q2">Don’t let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Cursed is the man who brought news to my father, saying,</p>

<p class="q">Let him hear a cry in the morning,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>because he didn’t kill me from the womb.</p>
<p class="q2">So my mother would have been my grave,</p>
<p class="q2">and her womb always great.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Why did I come out of the womb to see labor and sorrow,</p>

<p id="21" class="c">21</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchijah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Please inquire of Yahweh for us; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon makes war against us. Perhaps Yahweh will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may withdraw from us.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Then Jeremiah said to them, “Tell Zedekiah: <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>‘Yahweh, the God of Israel says, “Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans who besiege you outside the walls; and I will gather them into the middle of this city. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both man and animal. They will die of a great pestilence. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Afterward,” says Yahweh, “I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, his servants, and the people, even those who are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life. He will strike them with the edge of the sword. He will not spare them, have pity, or have mercy.”’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>“You shall say to this people, ‘Yahweh says: “Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>He who remains in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he who goes out, and passes over to the Chaldeans who besiege you, he will live, and he will escape with his life. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>For I have set my face on this city for evil, and not for good,” says Yahweh. “It will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire.”’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>“Concerning the house of the king of Judah, hear Yahweh’s word: <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>House of David, Yahweh says,</p>
<p class="q">‘Execute justice in the morning,</p>
<p class="q2">and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor,</p>
<p class="q">lest my wrath go out like fire,</p>
<p class="q2">and burn so that no one can quench it,</p>
<p class="q2">because of the evil of your doings.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley,</p>
<p class="q2">and of the rock of the plain,’ says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="q">‘You that say, “Who would come down against us?”</p>
<p class="q2">or “Who would enter into our homes?”</p>
<p class="q"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, says Yahweh;</p>

<p id="22" class="c">22</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Yahweh said, “Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak this word, there: <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>‘Hear Yahweh’s word, king of Judah, who sits on David’s throne, you, your servants, and your people who enter in by these gates. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Yahweh says: “Execute justice and righteousness, and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor.

Don’t shed innocent blood in this place. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>For if you do this thing indeed, then kings sitting on David’s throne will enter in by the gates of this house, riding in chariots and on horses, he, his servants, and his people. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>But if you will not hear these words, I swear by myself,” says Yahweh, “that this house will become a desolation.”’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>For Yahweh says concerning the house of the king of Judah:</p>
<p class="q">“You are Gilead to me,</p>
<p class="q2">the head of Lebanon.</p>
<p class="q">Yet surely I will make you a wilderness,</p>
<p class="q2">cities which are not inhabited.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>I will prepare destroyers against you,</p>
<p class="q2">everyone with his weapons,</p>
<p class="q">and they will cut down your choice cedars,</p>

<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>“Many nations will pass by this city, and they will each ask his neighbor, ‘Why has Yahweh done this to this great city?’ <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Then they will answer, ‘Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh their God, worshiped other gods, and served them.’”</p>
<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Don’t weep for the dead.</p>
<p class="q2">Don’t bemoan him;</p>
<p class="q">but weep bitterly for him who goes away,</p>
<p class="q2">for he will return no more,</p>
<p class="q2">and not see his native country.</p>
<p class="m"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>For Yahweh says touching Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and who went out of this place: “He won’t return there any more. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>But in the place where they have led him captive, there will he die. He will see this land no more.”</p>
<p class="q"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>“Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness,</p>
<p class="q2">and his rooms by injustice;</p>
<p class="q">who uses his neighbor’s service without wages,</p>
<p class="q2">and doesn’t give him his hire;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>who says, ‘I will build myself a wide house and spacious rooms,’</p>

<p class="q"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>“Should you reign, because you strive to excel in cedar?</p>

<p class="q2">Then it was well with him.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>He judged the cause of the poor and needy;</p>
<p class="q2">so it was well, then.</p>
<p class="q">Wasn’t this to know me?”</p>
<p class="q2">says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>But your eyes and your heart are only for your covetousness,</p>

<p class="q">They won’t lament for him,</p>
<p class="q2">saying ‘Ah lord!’ or, ‘Ah his glory!’</p>
<p class="q"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>He will be buried with the burial of a donkey,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>“Go up to Lebanon, and cry.</p>

<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Concerning the prophets:</p>

<p class="q"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Behold, Yahweh’s storm, his wrath, has gone out.</p>
<p class="q2">Yes, a whirling storm:</p>
<p class="q2">It will burst on the head of the wicked.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Yahweh’s anger will not return until he has executed,</p>
<p class="q2">and until he has performed the intents of his heart.</p>
<p class="q2">In the latter days, you will understand it perfectly.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>I didn’t send these prophets, yet they ran.</p>
<p class="q2">I didn’t speak to them, yet they prophesied.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>But if they had stood in my council,</p>
<p class="q2">then they would have caused my people to hear my words,</p>

<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>“Am I a God at hand,” says Yahweh,</p>
<p class="q2">“and not a God afar off?</p>

<p class="q2">so that I can’t see him?” says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="q2">“Don’t I fill heaven and earth?” says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>“I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies in my name, saying, ‘I had a dream!

<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>“Therefore behold, I am against the prophets,” says Yahweh, “who each steal my words from his neighbor. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>Behold, I am against the prophets,” says Yahweh, “who use their tongues, and say, ‘He says.’ <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams,” says Yahweh, “who tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting; yet I didn’t send them or command them.

<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>“When this people, or the prophet, or a priest, asks you, saying, ‘What is the message from Yahweh?’ Then you shall tell them, ‘“What message?

<p id="24" class="c">24</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Yahweh showed me, and behold, two baskets of figs were set before Yahweh’s temple, after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Then Yahweh asked me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?”</p>
<p class="p">I said, “Figs. The good figs are very good, and the bad are very bad, so bad that can’t be eaten.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>“Yahweh, the God of Israel says: ‘Like these good figs, so I will regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for good. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>For I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land. I will build them, and not pull them down. I will plant them, and not pluck them up. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Yahweh.

<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>“‘As the bad figs, which can’t be eaten, they are so bad,’ surely Yahweh says, ‘So I will give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the remnant of Jerusalem, who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>I will even give them up to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I will drive them. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, until they are consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.’”</p>
<p id="25" class="c">25</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (the same was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, these twenty-three years, Yahweh’s word has come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking; but you have not listened.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Yahweh has sent to you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them (but you have not listened or inclined your ear to hear), <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>saying, “Return now everyone from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that Yahweh has given to you and to your fathers, from of old and even forever more. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Don’t go after other gods to serve them or worship them, and don’t provoke me to anger with the work of your hands; then I will do you no harm.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>“Yet you have not listened to me,” says Yahweh; “that you may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Therefore Yahweh of Armies says: “Because you have not heard my words, <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,” says Yahweh, “and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations around. I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>This whole land will be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>“It will happen, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,” says Yahweh, “for their iniquity. I will make the land of the Chaldeans desolate forever. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>For many nations and great kings will make bondservants of them, even of them. I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>For Yahweh, the God of Israel, says to me: “Take this cup of the wine of wrath from my hand, and cause all the nations to whom I send you to drink it. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>They will drink, and reel back and forth, and be insane, because of the sword that I will send among them.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Then took I the cup at Yahweh’s hand, and made all the nations to drink, to whom Yahweh had sent me: <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, with its kings and its princes, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is today; <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Pharaoh king of Egypt, with his servants, his princes, and all his people; <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>and all the mixed people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the Philistines, Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod; <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Edom, Moab, and the children of Ammon; <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>and all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea; <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who have the corners of their beard cut off; <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>and all the kings of Arabia, all the kings of the mixed people who dwell in the wilderness; <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>and all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes; <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are on the surface of the earth.

<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>“You shall tell them, ‘Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: “Drink, and be drunk, vomit, fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.”’ <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>It shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink, then you shall tell them, ‘Yahweh of Armies says: “You shall surely drink. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>For, behold, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name; and should you be utterly unpunished?

<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>“Therefore prophesy against them all these words, and tell them,</p>

<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Yahweh of Armies says,</p>

<p class="m"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>The slain of Yahweh will be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth. They won’t be lamented. They won’t be gathered or buried. They will be dung on the surface of the ground.</p>

<p class="q"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>The peaceful folds are brought to silence</p>

<p id="26" class="c">26</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from Yahweh: <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Yahweh says: ‘Stand in the court of Yahweh’s house, and speak to all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in Yahweh’s house, all the words that I command you to speak to them. Don’t omit a word. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>It may be they will listen, and every man turn from his evil way; that I may relent from the evil which I intend to do to them because of the evil of their doings.’ <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>You shall tell them, “Yahweh says: ‘If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you, <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>to listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send to you, even rising up early and sending them, but you have not listened; <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>then I will make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.”’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in Yahweh’s house. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>When Jeremiah had finished speaking all that Yahweh had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, saying, “You shall surely die! <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Why have you prophesied in Yahweh’s name, saying, ‘This house will be like Shiloh, and this city will be desolate, without inhabitant?’” All the people were crowded around Jeremiah in Yahweh’s house.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house to Yahweh’s house; and they sat in the entry of the new gate of Yahweh’s house. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and to all the people, saying, “This man is worthy of death; for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people, saying, “Yahweh sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey Yahweh your God’s voice; then Yahweh will relent from the evil that he has pronounced against you. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>But as for me, behold, I am in your hand. Do with me what is good and right in your eyes. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Only know for certain that, if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, on this city, and on its inhabitants; for in truth Yahweh has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets: “This man is not worthy of death; for he has spoken to us in the name of Yahweh our God.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Then certain of the elders of the land rose up, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying, <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>“Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies says:</p>
<p class="q">“‘Zion will be plowed as a field,</p>
<p class="q2">and Jerusalem will become heaps,</p>
<p class="q2">and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.’</p>
<p class="m"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Didn’t he fear Yahweh, and entreat the favor of Yahweh, and Yahweh relented of the disaster which he had pronounced against them? We would commit great evil against our own souls that way!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>There was also a man who prophesied in Yahweh’s name, Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath Jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>When Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Then Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt; <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>and they fetched Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king, who killed him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that they didn’t give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.</p>
<p id="27" class="c">27</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Yahweh says to me: “Make bonds and bars, and put them on your neck. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Then send them to the king of Edom, to the king of Moab, to the king of the children of Ammon, to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Give them a command to their masters, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says, “You shall tell your masters: <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>‘I have made the earth, the men, and the animals that are on the surface of the earth by my great power and by my outstretched arm. I give it to whom it seems right to me. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant. I have also given the animals of the field to him to serve him. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>All the nations will serve him, his son, and his son’s son, until the time of his own land comes. Then many nations and great kings will make him their bondservant.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>“‘“‘It will happen that I will punish the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon,’ says Yahweh, ‘with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>But as for you, don’t listen to your prophets, to your diviners, to your dreams, to your soothsayers, or to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, “You shall not serve the king of Babylon;” <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>for they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land, so that I would drive you out, and you would perish. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>But the nation that brings their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him, that nation I will let remain in their own land,’ says Yahweh; ‘and they will till it and dwell in it.’”’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as Yahweh has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Don’t listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon;’ for they prophesy a lie to you. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>For I have not sent them,” says Yahweh, “but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I may drive you out, and that you may perish, you, and the prophets who prophesy to you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Yahweh says, “Don’t listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, ‘Behold, the vessels of Yahweh’s house will now shortly be brought again from Babylon;’ for they prophesy a lie to you. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Don’t listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon, and live. Why should this city become a desolation? <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>But if they are prophets, and if Yahweh’s word is with them, let them now make intercession to Yahweh of Armies, that the vessels which are left in Yahweh’s house, in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, don’t go to Babylon. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>For Yahweh of Armies says concerning the pillars, concerning the sea, concerning the bases, and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city, <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon didn’t take when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>yes, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says concerning the vessels that are left in Yahweh’s house, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem: <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>‘They will be carried to Babylon, and there they will be, until the day that I visit them,’ says Yahweh; ‘then I will bring them up, and restore them to this place.’”</p>
<p id="28" class="c">28</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>That same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in Yahweh’s house, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Yahweh’s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried to Babylon. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, who went to Babylon,’ says Yahweh; ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people who stood in Yahweh’s house, <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>even the prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May Yahweh do so. May Yahweh perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring again the vessels of Yahweh’s house, and all those who are captives, from Babylon to this place. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Nevertheless listen now to this word that I speak in your ears, and in the ears of all the people: <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, of evil, and of pestilence. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet happens, then the prophet will be known, that Yahweh has truly sent him.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and broke it. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “Yahweh says: ‘Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from off the neck of all the nations within two full years.’” Then the prophet Jeremiah went his way.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>“Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, ‘Yahweh says, “You have broken the bars of wood, but you have made in their place bars of iron.” <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says, “I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they will serve him. I have also given him the animals of the field.”’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen, Hananiah! Yahweh has not sent you, but you make this people trust in a lie. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Therefore Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will send you away from off the surface of the earth. This year you will die, because you have spoken rebellion against Yahweh.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.</p>
<p id="29" class="c">29</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>(after Jeconiah the king, the queen mother, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the smiths, had departed from Jerusalem), <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon). It said:</p>
<p class="pi"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says to all the captives whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon: <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>“Build houses and dwell in them. Plant gardens and eat their fruit. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Take wives and father sons and daughters. Take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters. Multiply there, and don’t be diminished. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray to Yahweh for it; for in its peace you will have peace.” <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: “Don’t let your prophets who are among you and your diviners deceive you. Don’t listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>For they prophesy falsely to you in my name. I have not sent them,” says Yahweh. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>For Yahweh says, “After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>For I know the thoughts that I think toward you,” says Yahweh, “thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you hope and a future. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>You shall call on me, and you shall go and pray to me, and I will listen to you. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>You shall seek me, and find me, when you search for me with all your heart. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>I will be found by you,” says Yahweh, “and I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places where I have driven you, says Yahweh. I will bring you again to the place from where I caused you to be carried away captive.”</p>
<p class="pi"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Because you have said, “Yahweh has raised us up prophets in Babylon;” <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Yahweh says concerning the king who sits on David’s throne, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your brothers who haven’t gone with you into captivity; <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Yahweh of Armies says: “Behold, I will send on them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like rotten figs that can’t be eaten, they are so bad. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an object of horror, an astonishment, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them, <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>because they have not listened to my words,” says Yahweh, “with which I sent to them my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but you would not hear,” says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="pi"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Hear therefore Yahweh’s word, all you captives, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in my name: “Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and he will kill them before your eyes. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>A curse will be taken up about them by all the captives of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, ‘Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;’ <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>because they have done foolish things in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I didn’t command them. I am he who knows, and am witness,” says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying, <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>“Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying, <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>“Yahweh has made you priest in the place of Jehoiada the priest, that there may be officers in Yahweh’s house, for every man who is crazy, and makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in the stocks and in shackles. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself a prophet to you, <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>because he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, The captivity is long. Build houses, and dwell in them. Plant gardens, and eat their fruit?”’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying, <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>“Send to all of the captives, saying, ‘Yahweh says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: “Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I didn’t send him, and he has caused you to trust in a lie;” <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>therefore Yahweh says, “Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his offspring.<span class="f">+ or, seed</span> He will not have a man to dwell among this people. He won’t see the good that I will do to my people,” says Yahweh, “because he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh.”’”</p>
<p id="30" class="c">30</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>For, behold, the days come,’ says Yahweh, ‘that I will reverse the captivity of my people Israel and Judah,’ says Yahweh. ‘I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they will possess it.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>These are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>For Yahweh says:</p>
<p class="q">“We have heard a voice of trembling;</p>
<p class="q2">a voice of fear, and not of peace.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Ask now, and see whether a man travails with child.</p>
<p class="q2">Why do I see every man with his hands on his waist, as a woman in travail,</p>
<p class="q2">and all faces are turned pale?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it.</p>
<p class="q2">It is even the time of Jacob’s trouble;</p>
<p class="q2">but he will be saved out of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>It will come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I will break his yoke from off your neck,</p>
<p class="q2">and will burst your bonds.</p>
<p class="q2">Strangers will no more make them their bondservants;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>but they will serve Yahweh their God,</p>
<p class="q2">and David their king,</p>
<p class="q2">whom I will raise up to them.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Therefore don’t be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="q2">Don’t be dismayed, Israel.</p>
<p class="q">For, behold, I will save you from afar,</p>
<p class="q2">and save your offspring<span class="f">+ or, seed</span> from the land of their captivity.</p>
<p class="q">Jacob will return,</p>
<p class="q2">and will be quiet and at ease.</p>
<p class="q2">No one will make him afraid.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>For I am with you, says Yahweh, to save you;</p>
<p class="q2">for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you,</p>
<p class="q2">but I will not make a full end of you;</p>
<p class="q">but I will correct you in measure,</p>
<p class="q2">and will in no way leave you unpunished.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>For Yahweh says,</p>
<p class="q">“Your hurt is incurable.</p>
<p class="q2">Your wound is grievous.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>There is no one to plead your cause,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>All your lovers have forgotten you.</p>
<p class="q2">They don’t seek you.</p>
<p class="q">For I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy,</p>
<p class="q2">with the chastisement of a cruel one,</p>
<p class="q">for the greatness of your iniquity,</p>
<p class="q2">because your sins were increased.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Why do you cry over your injury?</p>
<p class="q2">Your pain is incurable.</p>
<p class="q">For the greatness of your iniquity,</p>
<p class="q2">because your sins have increased,</p>
<p class="q2">I have done these things to you.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Therefore all those who devour you will be devoured.</p>
<p class="q2">All your adversaries, everyone of them, will go into captivity.</p>
<p class="q">Those who plunder you will be plunder.</p>
<p class="q2">I will make all who prey on you become prey.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>For I will restore health to you,</p>
<p class="q2">and I will heal you of your wounds,” says Yahweh;</p>
<p class="q">“because they have called you an outcast,</p>
<p class="q2">saying, ‘It is Zion, whom no man seeks after.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Yahweh says:</p>
<p class="q">“Behold, I will reverse the captivity of Jacob’s tents,</p>
<p class="q2">and have compassion on his dwelling places.</p>
<p class="q">The city will be built on its own hill,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Thanksgiving will proceed out of them</p>

<p class="q">I will cause him to draw near,</p>

<p class="q"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>“You shall be my people,</p>

<p id="31" class="c">31</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>“At that time,” says Yahweh, “I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be my people.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Yahweh says, “The people who survive the sword found favor in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Yahweh appeared of old to me, saying,</p>

<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>“I commanded Baruch before them, saying, <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may last many days.’ <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Houses and fields and vineyards will yet again be bought in this land.’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to Yahweh, saying,</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="mi"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>“Ah Lord Yahweh! Behold, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for you, <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>who show loving kindness to thousands, and repay the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them; the great, the mighty God, Yahweh of Armies is his name; <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, to give everyone according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings; <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>who performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, both in Israel and among other men; and made yourself a name, as it is today; <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>and brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, with wonders, with a strong hand, with an outstretched arm, and with great terror; <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>and gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>They came in and possessed it, but they didn’t obey your voice and didn’t walk in your law. They have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do. Therefore you have caused all this evil to come upon them.</p>
<p class="pi"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>“Behold, siege ramps have come to the city to take it. The city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, of the famine, and of the pestilence. What you have spoken has happened. Behold, you see it. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>You have said to me, Lord Yahweh, ‘Buy the field for money, and call witnesses;’ whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying, <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>“Behold, I am Yahweh, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for me? <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Therefore Yahweh says: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will take it. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>The Chaldeans, who fight against this city, will come and set this city on fire, and burn it with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>“For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says Yahweh. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day, so that I should remove it from before my face, <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger: they, their kings, their princes, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>They have turned their backs to me, and not their faces. Although I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it. <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through fire to Molech; which I didn’t command them. It didn’t even come into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>Now therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says concerning this city, about which you say, “It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:” <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>“Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries where I have driven them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again to this place. I will cause them to dwell safely. <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>Then they will be my people, and I will be their God. <span id="39" class="v">39 </span>I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for their good, and the good of their children after them. <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good. I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me. <span id="41" class="v">41 </span>Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="42" class="v">42 </span>For Yahweh says: “Just as I have brought all this great evil on this people, so will I bring on them all the good that I have promised them. <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>Fields will be bought in this land, about which you say, ‘It is desolate, without man or animal. It is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’ <span id="44" class="v">44 </span>Men will buy fields for money, sign the deeds, seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South; for I will cause their captivity to be reversed,” says Yahweh.</p>
<p id="33" class="c">33</p>
<p class="nb"></p><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Moreover Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was still locked up in the court of the guard, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Yahweh who does it, Yahweh who forms it to establish it—Yahweh is his name, says: <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>‘Call to me, and I will answer you, and will show you great and difficult things, which you don’t know.’ <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>For Yahweh, the God of Israel, says concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down to make a defense against the mounds and against the sword; <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>while men come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have killed in my anger and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hidden my face from this city: <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>‘Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them; and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against me. I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned against me and by which they have transgressed against me. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>This city will be to me for a name of joy, for praise, and for glory, before all the nations of the earth, which will hear all the good that I do to them, and will fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I provide to it.’”
  
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Yahweh says: “Yet again there will be heard in this place, about which you say, ‘It is waste, without man and without animal, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without animal,’ <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, ‘Give thanks to Yahweh of Armies, for Yahweh is good, for his loving kindness endures forever;’ who bring thanksgiving into Yahweh’s house. For I will cause the captivity of the land to be reversed as at the first,” says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Yahweh of Armies says: “Yet again there will be in this place, which is waste, without man and without animal, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the South, in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of him who counts them,” says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>“Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>“In those days and at that time,</p>
<p class="q2">I will cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David.</p>
<p class="q2">He will execute justice and righteousness in the land.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>In those days Judah will be saved,</p>
<p class="q2">and Jerusalem will dwell safely.</p>
<p class="q">This is the name by which she will be called:</p>
<p class="q2">Yahweh our righteousness.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>For Yahweh says: “David will never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>The priests the Levites won’t lack a man before me to offer burnt offerings, to burn meal offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying, <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>“Yahweh says: ‘If you can break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night, so that there will not be day and night in their time; <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>then may my covenant also be broken with David my servant, that he won’t have a son to reign on his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>As the army of the sky can’t be counted, and the sand of the sea can’t be measured; so I will multiply the offspring<span class="f">+ or, seed</span> of David my servant and the Levites who minister to me.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying, <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>“Don’t consider what this people has spoken, saying, ‘Has Yahweh cast off the two families which he chose?’ Thus they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.” <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Yahweh says: “If my covenant of day and night fails, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth; <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>then I will also cast away the offspring<span class="f">+ or, seed</span> of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his offspring<span class="f">+ or, seed</span> to be rulers over the offspring<span class="f">+ or, seed</span> of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to be reversed and will have mercy on them.”</p>
<p id="34" class="c">34</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, with all his army, all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem and against all its cities, saying: <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Yahweh says, “Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon and he will burn it with fire. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>You won’t escape out of his hand, but will surely be taken and delivered into his hand. Your eyes will see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he will speak with you mouth to mouth. You will go to Babylon.”’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>“Yet hear Yahweh’s word, O Zedekiah king of Judah: Yahweh says concerning you, ‘You won’t die by the sword. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>You will die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they will make a burning for you. They will lament you, saying, “Ah Lord!” for I have spoken the word,’ says Yahweh.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>when the king of Babylon’s army was fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>The word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them; <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>that every man should let his male servant, and every man his female servant, who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that no one should make bondservants of them, of a Jew his brother. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>All the princes and all the people obeyed who had entered into the covenant, that everyone should let his male servant, and everyone his female servant go free, that no one should make bondservants of them any more. They obeyed and let them go; <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Therefore Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>“Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: ‘I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying, <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>At the end of seven years, every man of you shall release his brother who is a Hebrew, who has been sold to you, and has served you six years. You shall let him go free from you; but your fathers didn’t listen to me, and didn’t incline their ear. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>You had now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes, in every man proclaiming liberty to his neighbor. You had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name; <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>but you turned and profaned my name, and every man caused his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom you had let go free at their pleasure, to return. You brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Therefore Yahweh says: “You have not listened to me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor. Behold, I proclaim to you a liberty,” says Yahweh, “to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine. I will make you be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts: <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf; <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life. Their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>“I will give Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes into the hands of their enemies, into the hands of those who seek their life and into the hands of the king of Babylon’s army, who has gone away from you. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Behold, I will command,” says Yahweh, “and cause them to return to this city. They will fight against it, take it, and burn it with fire. I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.”</p>
<p id="35" class="c">35</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into Yahweh’s house, into one of the rooms, and give them wine to drink.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, with his brothers, all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites; <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>and I brought them into Yahweh’s house, into the room of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was by the room of the princes, which was above the room of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>But they said, “We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall drink no wine, neither you, nor your sons, forever. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>You shall not build a house, sow seed, plant a vineyard, or have any; but all your days you shall dwell in tents, that you may live many days in the land in which you live as nomads.’ <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters; <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>and not to build houses for ourselves to dwell in. We have no vineyard, field, or seed; <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, we said, ‘Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we will dwell at Jerusalem.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying, <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>“Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “Will you not receive instruction to listen to my words?” says Yahweh. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>“The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; and to this day they drink none, for they obey their father’s commandment; but I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking, and you have not listened to me. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, ‘Every one of you must return now from his evil way, amend your doings, and don’t go after other gods to serve them, then you will dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers:’ but you have not inclined your ear, nor listened to me. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to me.”’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>“Therefore Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard; and I have called to them, but they have not answered.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, “Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according to all that he commanded you;’ <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>therefore Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Jonadab the son of Rechab will not lack a man to stand before me forever.’”</p>
<p id="36" class="c">36</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Take a scroll of a book, and write in it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I intend to do to them; that they may each return from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all Yahweh’s words, which he had spoken to him, on a scroll of a book. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, “I am restricted. I can’t go into Yahweh’s house. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Therefore you go, and read from the scroll which you have written from my mouth, Yahweh’s words, in the ears of the people in Yahweh’s house on the fast day. Also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>It may be they will present their supplication before Yahweh, and will each return from his evil way; for Yahweh has pronounced great anger and wrath against this people.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book Yahweh’s words in Yahweh’s house. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Yahweh. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Then Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the book in Yahweh’s house, in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan, the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of Yahweh’s house, in the ears of all the people.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all Yahweh’s words, <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s room: and behold, all the princes were sitting there, Elishama the scribe, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll in which you have read in the ears of the people, and come.”</p>
<p class="p">So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand, and came to them.
    <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>They said to him, “Sit down now, and read it in our hearing.”</p>
<p class="p">So Baruch read it in their hearing.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Now when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to Baruch, “We will surely tell the king of all these words.” <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>They asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us now, how did you write all these words at his mouth?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Then Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Then the princes said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah go hide. Don’t let anyone know where you are.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>They went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe. Then they told all the words in the hearing of the king. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll; and he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king, and in the hearing of all the princes who stood beside the king. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month; and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>When Jehudi had read three or four leaves, the king cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>The king and his servants who heard all these words were not afraid, and didn’t tear their garments. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll; but he would not listen to them. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>The king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Yahweh hid them.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, after the king had burned the scroll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying, <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>“Take again another scroll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Yahweh says: “You have burned this scroll, saying, “Why have you written therein, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cause to cease from there man and animal?’”’ <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Therefore Yahweh says concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: “He will have no one to sit on David’s throne. His dead body will be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>I will punish him, his offspring,<span class="f">+ or, seed</span> and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring on them, on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they didn’t listen.”’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Then took Jeremiah another scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them.</p>
<p id="37" class="c">37</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, listened to Yahweh’s words, which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “Pray now to Yahweh our God for us.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they had not put him into prison. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Pharaoh’s army had come out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they broke up from Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Then Yahweh’s word came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>“Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘You shall tell the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me: “Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which has come out to help you, will return to Egypt into their own land. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>The Chaldeans will come again, and fight against this city. They will take it and burn it with fire.”’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>“Yahweh says, ‘Don’t deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will surely depart from us;” for they will not depart. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>For though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yes they would each rise up in his tent and burn this city with fire.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>When the army of the Chaldeans had broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army, <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>then Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the middle of the people. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>When he was in Benjamin’s gate, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are defecting to the Chaldeans!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Then Jeremiah said, “That is false! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans.”</p>
<p class="p">But he didn’t listen to him; so Irijah siezed Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.
    <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>The princes were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>When Jeremiah had come into the dungeon house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days, <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>then Zedekiah the king sent, and had him brought out. The king asked him secretly in his house, “Is there any word from Yahweh?”</p>
<p class="p">Jeremiah said, “There is.” He also said, “You will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, “How have I sinned against you, against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison? <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Now where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you, nor against this land?’ <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Now please hear, my lord the king: please let my supplication be presented before you, that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard. They gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was gone. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</p>
<p id="38" class="c">38</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Yahweh says, ‘He who remains in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he who goes out to the Chaldeans will live, and he will escape with his life, and he will live.’ <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Yahweh says, ‘This city will surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will take it.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Then the princes said to the king, “Please let this man be put to death; because he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man doesn’t seek the welfare of this people, but harm.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Zedekiah the king said, “Behold, he is in your hand; for the king can’t do anything to oppose you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Then took they Jeremiah and threw him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king’s son, that was in the court of the guard. They let down Jeremiah with cords. In the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king was then sitting in Benjamin’s gate), <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Ebedmelech went out of the king’s house, and spoke to the king, saying, <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>“My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon. He is likely to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take from here thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dies.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took from there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Now put these rags and worn-out garments under your armpits under the cords.”</p>
<p class="p">Jeremiah did so.
    <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Then Zedekiah the king sent and took Jeremiah the prophet to himself into the third entry that is in Yahweh’s house. Then the king said to Jeremiah, “I will ask you something. Hide nothing from me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? If I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, “As Yahweh lives, who made us this soul, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you will go out to the king of Babylon’s princes, then your soul will live, and this city will not be burned with fire. You will live, along with your house. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>But if you will not go out to the king of Babylon’s princes, then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you won’t escape out of their hand.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have defected to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>But Jeremiah said, “They won’t deliver you. Obey, I beg you, Yahweh’s voice, in that which I speak to you; so it will be well with you, and your soul will live. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>But if you refuse to go out, this is the word that Yahweh has shown me: <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>‘Behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah’s house will be brought out to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women will say,</p>
<p class="q">“Your familiar friends have turned on you,</p>
<p class="q2">and have prevailed over you.</p>
<p class="q">Your feet are sunk in the mire,</p>
<p class="q2">they have turned away from you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>They will bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans. You won’t escape out of their hand, but will be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon. You will cause this city to be burned with fire.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no man know of these words, and you won’t die. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you, and tell you, ‘Declare to us now what you have said to the king; don’t hide it from us, and we will not put you to death; also tell us what the king said to you;’ <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>then you shall tell them, ‘I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Then all the princes came to Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they stopped speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.</p>
<p id="39" class="c">39</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem, and besieged it. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>All the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, Nergal Sharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. When they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgment on him. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Then the king of Babylon killed Zedekiah’s sons in Riblah before his eyes. The king of Babylon also killed all the nobles of Judah. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>The Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people who remained in the city, the deserters also who fell away to him, and the residue of the people who remained. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon commanded Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard concerning Jeremiah, saying, <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>“Take him, and take care of him. Do him no harm; but do to him even as he tells you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, with Nebushazban, Rabsaris, and Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon; <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home. So he lived among the people.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Now Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying, <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>“Go, and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: “Behold, I will bring my words on this city for evil, and not for good; and they will be accomplished before you in that day. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>But I will deliver you in that day,” says Yahweh; “and you will not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>For I will surely save you, and you won’t fall by the sword, but you will escape with your life; because you have put your trust in me,” says Yahweh.’”</p>
<p id="40" class="c">40</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away captive to Babylon. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>The captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, “Yahweh your God pronounced this evil on this place; <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>and Yahweh has brought it, and done according as he spoke. Because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing has come on you. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Now, behold, I release you today from the chains which are on your hand. If it seems good to you to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will take care of you; but if it seems bad to you to come with me into Babylon, don’t. Behold, all the land is before you. Where it seems good and right to you to go, there go.” <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Now while he had not yet gone back, “Go back then,” he said, “to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wherever it seems right to you to go.”</p>
<p class="p">So the captain of the guard gave him food and a present, and let him go.
    <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and lived with him among the people who were left in the land.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, women, children, and of the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon; <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men came to Gedaliah to Mizpah. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, “Don’t be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who will come to us; but you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered very much wine and summer fruits.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>and said to him, “Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?”</p>
<p class="p">But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam didn’t believe them.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, “Please let me go, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man will know it. Why should he take your life, that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You shall not do this thing; for you speak falsely of Ishmael.”</p>
<p id="41" class="c">41</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal offspring<span class="f">+ or, seed</span> and one of the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah arose, and the ten men who were with him, and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>The second day after he had killed Gedaliah, and no man knew it, <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, having their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with meal offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to Yahweh’s house. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and as he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.” <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>It was so, when they came into the middle of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them, and cast them into the middle of the pit, he, and the men who were with him. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>But ten men were found among those who said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey.”</p>
<p class="p">So he stopped, and didn’t kill them among their brothers.
    <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had killed, by the side of Gedaliah (the same was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were killed.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Then Ishmael carried away captive all the of the people who were left in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Now when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, then they were glad. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>So all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces who were with him took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the men of war, with the women, the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>They departed and lived in Geruth Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land.</p>
<p id="42" class="c">42</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, came near, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Please let our supplication be presented before you, and pray for us to Yahweh your God, even for all this remnant; for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes see us; <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>that Yahweh your God may show us the way in which we should walk, and the things that we should do.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you. Behold, I will pray to Yahweh your God according to your words; and it will happen that whatever thing Yahweh answers you, I will declare it to you. I will keep nothing back from you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Then they said to Jeremiah, “May Yahweh be a true and faithful witness among us, if we don’t do according to all the word with which Yahweh your God sends you to tell us. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Whether it is good, or whether it is bad, we will obey the voice of Yahweh our God, to whom we send you; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of Yahweh our God.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>After ten days, Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>and said to them, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your supplication before him, says: <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>‘If you will still live in this land, then I will build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I grieve over the distress that I have brought on you. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Don’t be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid. Don’t be afraid of him,’ says Yahweh: ‘for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you, and cause you to return to your own land.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>“‘But if you say, “We will not dwell in this land;” so that you don’t obey Yahweh your God’s voice, <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>saying, “No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we will see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:”’ <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>now therefore hear Yahweh’s word, O remnant of Judah: Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘If you indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to live there; <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>then it will happen that the sword, which you fear, will overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are afraid, will follow close behind you there in Egypt; and you will die there. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>So will it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there. They will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. None of them will remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.’ <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘As my anger and my wrath has been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured out on you, when you enter into Egypt; and you will be an object of horror, an astonishment, a curse, and a reproach; and you will see this place no more.’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>“Yahweh has spoken concerning you, remnant of Judah, ‘Don’t go into Egypt!’ Know certainly that I have testified to you today. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>For you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for you sent me to Yahweh your God, saying, ‘Pray for us to Yahweh our God; and according to all that Yahweh our God says, so declare to us, and we will do it.’ <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>I have declared it to you today; but you have not obeyed Yahweh your God’s voice in anything for which he has sent me to you. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Now therefore know certainly that you will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence in the place where you desire to go to live there.”</p>
<p id="43" class="c">43</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>When Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God, with which Yahweh their God had sent him to them, even all these words, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>then Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men spoke, saying to Jeremiah, “You speak falsely. Yahweh our God has not sent you to say, ‘You shall not go into Egypt to live there;’ <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>but Baruch the son of Neriah has turned you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captive to Babylon.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, didn’t obey Yahweh’s voice, to dwell in the land of Judah. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, who had returned from all the nations where they had been driven, to live in the land of Judah; <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>the men, and the women, and the children, and the king’s daughters, and every person who Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah; <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>and they came into the land of Egypt; for they didn’t obey Yahweh’s voice: and they came to Tahpanhes.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>“Take great stones in your hand, and hide them in mortar in the brick work, which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah; <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>and tell them, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne on these stones that I have hidden; and he will spread his royal pavilion over them. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>He will come, and will strike the land of Egypt; such as are for death will be put to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt. He will burn them, and carry them away captive. He will array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he will go out from there in peace. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>He will also break the pillars of Beth Shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and he will burn the houses of the gods of Egypt with fire.’”</p>
<p id="44" class="c">44</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt, who lived at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in the country of Pathros, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘You have seen all the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, and on all the cities of Judah. Behold, today they are a desolation, and no man dwells in them, <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, to serve other gods that they didn’t know, neither they, nor you, nor your fathers. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>However I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, “Oh, don’t do this abominable thing that I hate.” <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>But they didn’t listen and didn’t incline their ear. They didn’t turn from their wickedness, to stop burning incense to other gods. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Therefore my wrath and my anger was poured out, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is today.’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>“Therefore now Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Why do you commit great evil against your own souls, to cut off from yourselves man and woman, infant and nursing child out of the middle of Judah, to leave yourselves no one remaining; <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>in that you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you have gone to live; that you may be cut off, and that you may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>“Therefore Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to live there, and they will all be consumed. They will fall in the land of Egypt. They will be consumed by the sword and by the famine. They will die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine. They will be an object of horror, an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>so that none of the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there, will escape or be left to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there; for no one will return except those who will escape.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, even all the people who lived in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>“As for the word that you have spoken to us in Yahweh’s name, we will not listen to you. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>But we will certainly perform every word that has gone out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of food, and were well, and saw no evil. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of the sky, and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>“When we burned incense to the queen of the sky, and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings to her, without our husbands?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people who had given him an answer, saying, <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>“The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, didn’t Yahweh remember them, and didn’t it come into his mind? <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Thus Yahweh could no longer bear it, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which you have committed. Therefore your land has become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is today. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Because you have burned incense, and because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed Yahweh’s voice, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil has happened to you, as it is today.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, “Hear Yahweh’s word, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt! <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘You and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and with your hands have fulfilled it, saying, “We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to her.”</p>
<p class="p">“‘Establish then your vows, and perform your vows.’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>“Therefore hear Yahweh’s word, all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: ‘Behold, I have sworn by my great name,’ says Yahweh, ‘that my name will no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, “As the Lord Yahweh lives.” <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until they are all gone. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Those who escape the sword will return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah few in number. All the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there, will know whose word will stand, mine or theirs.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>“‘This will be the sign to you,’ says Yahweh, ‘that I will punish you in this place, that you may know that my words will surely stand against you for evil.’ <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of those who seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy, and sought his life.’”</p>
<p id="45" class="c">45</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The message that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Yahweh, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch: <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>‘You said, “Woe is me now! For Yahweh has added sorrow to my pain! I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.”’</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>“You shall tell him, Yahweh says: ‘Behold, that which I have built, I will break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up; and this in the whole land. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Do you seek great things for yourself? Don’t seek them; for, behold, I will bring evil on all flesh,’ says Yahweh; ‘but I will let you escape with your life wherever you go.’”</p>

<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden. Now the Chaldeans were against the city all around. The men of war went toward the Arabah, <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>but the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgment on him. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. He also killed all the princes of Judah in Riblah. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>He put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison until the day of his death.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>He burned Yahweh’s house, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, he burned with fire. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vineyard keepers and farmers.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>The Chaldeans broke the pillars of brass that were in Yahweh’s house, and the bases and the bronze sea that were in Yahweh’s house in pieces, and carried all of their brass to Babylon. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>The captain of the guard took away the cups, the fire pans, the basins, the pots, the lamp stands, the spoons, and the bowls; that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>They took the two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for Yahweh’s house. The brass of all these vessels was without weight. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits;<span class="f">+ A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters.</span> and a line of twelve cubits encircled it; and its thickness was four fingers. It was hollow. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>A capital of brass was on it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits,<span class="f">+ A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters.</span> with network and pomegranates on the capital all around, all of brass: and the second pillar also had like these, and pomegranates. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were one hundred on the network all around.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold: <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war; and seven men of those who saw the king’s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the middle of the city. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>The king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath.</p>
<p class="p">So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.
    <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive:</p>
<p class="m">in the seventh year, three thousand twenty-three Jews;</p>
<p class="m"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty-two persons;</p>
<p class="m"><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty-five people:</p>
<p class="m">all the people were four thousand six hundred.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>In the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and released him from prison. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>He spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon, <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>and changed his prison garments. Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>For his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.</p>
