<p class="mt">Paul’s Letter to the Colossians</p>
<p id="1" class="c">1</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>to the saints and faithful brothers<span class="f">+ The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”</span> in Christ at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have toward all the saints, <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the Good News, <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>which has come to you; even as it is in all the world and is bearing fruit and growing, as it does in you also, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth; <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>even as you learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf, <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>who also declared to us your love in the Spirit. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>For this cause, we also, since the day we heard this, don’t cease praying and making requests for you, that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>that you may walk worthily of the Lord, to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, for all endurance and perseverance with joy; <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>giving thanks to the Father, who made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light; <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love; <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>in whom we have our redemption,<span class="f">+ TR adds “through his blood,”</span>  the forgiveness of our sins; <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>For by him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and for him. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>He is before all things, and in him all things are held together. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>He is the head of the body, the assembly, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>For all the fullness was pleased to dwell in him; <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>and through him to reconcile all things to himself, by him, whether things on the earth, or things in the heavens, having made peace through the blood of his cross.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>You, being in past times alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil deeds, <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>yet now he has reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without defect and blameless before him, <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>if it is so that you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the Good News which you heard, which is being proclaimed in all creation under heaven; of which I, Paul, was made a servant.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the assembly; <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>of which I was made a servant, according to the stewardship of God which was given me toward you, to fulfill the word of God, <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>the mystery which has been hidden for ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to his saints, <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>to whom God was pleased to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory; <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus; <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>for which I also labor, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.</p>
<p id="2" class="c">2</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>For I desire to have you know how greatly I struggle for you, and for those at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh; <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love, and gaining all riches of the full assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ, <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Now this I say that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>For though I am absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>As therefore you received Christ Jesus, the Lord, walk in him, <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, even as you were taught, abounding in it in thanksgiving. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Be careful that you don’t let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the elements of the world, and not after Christ. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>For in him all the fullness of the Deity dwells bodily, <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>and in him you are made full, who is the head of all principality and power; <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>in whom you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ; <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>You were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh. He made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us; and he has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross; <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>having stripped the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Let no one therefore judge you in eating, or in drinking, or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day, <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ’s. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Let no one rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and worshiping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>and not holding firmly to the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and ligaments, grows with God’s growth. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances, <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>“Don’t handle, nor taste, nor touch” <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>(all of which perish with use), according to the precepts and doctrines of men? <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Which things indeed appear like wisdom in self-imposed worship, and humility, and severity to the body; but aren’t of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.</p>
<p id="3" class="c">3</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>If then you were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>When Christ, our life, is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry; <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>for which things’ sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>You also once walked in those, when you lived in them; <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>but now you also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your mouth. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Don’t lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings, <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator, <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>where there can’t be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, freeman; but Christ is all, and in all.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Put on therefore, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and perseverance; <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, so you also do.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father, through him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Husbands, love your wives, and don’t be bitter against them.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Children, obey your parents in all things, for this pleases the Lord.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Fathers, don’t provoke your children, so that they won’t be discouraged.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Servants, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are looking, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>And whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord, and not for men, <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>But he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality.</p>
<p id="4" class="c">4</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Continue steadfastly in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving; <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>praying together for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds; <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>that I may reveal it as I ought to speak. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>All my affairs will be made known to you by Tychicus, the beloved brother, faithful servant, and fellow bondservant in the Lord. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts, <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you everything that is going on here. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you received commandments, “if he comes to you, receive him”), <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>and Jesus who is called Justus. These are my only fellow workers for God’s Kingdom who are of the circumcision, men who have been a comfort to me.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always striving for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>For I testify about him, that he has great zeal for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for those in Hierapolis. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the assembly that is in his house. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>When this letter has been read among you, cause it to be read also in the assembly of the Laodiceans; and that you also read the letter from Laodicea. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Tell Archippus, “Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>The salutation of me, Paul, with my own hand: remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>
