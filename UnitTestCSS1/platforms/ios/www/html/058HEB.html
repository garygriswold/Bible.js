<p class="mt">The Letter to the Hebrews</p>
<p id="1" class="c">1</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, who, when he had by himself purified us of our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>having become so much better than the angels, as he has inherited a more excellent name than they have. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>For to which of the angels did he say at any time,</p>
<p class="q">“You are my Son.</p>
<p class="q2">Today I have become your father?”<span class="x">+ Psalm 2:7</span></p>
<p class="p">and again,</p>
<p class="q">“I will be to him a Father,</p>
<p class="q2">and he will be to me a Son?”<span class="x">+ 2 Samuel 7:14; 1 Chronicles 17:13</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>When he again brings in the firstborn into the world he says, “Let all the angels of God worship him.”<span class="x">+ Deuteronomy 32:43 LXX</span><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Of the angels he says,</p>
<p class="q">“Who makes his angels winds,</p>
<p class="q2">and his servants a flame of fire.”<span class="x">+ Psalm 104:4</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>But of the Son he says,</p>
<p class="q">“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.</p>
<p class="q2">The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity;</p>
<p class="q2">therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.”<span class="x">+ Psalm 45:6-7</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>And,</p>
<p class="q">“You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth.</p>
<p class="q2">The heavens are the works of your hands.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>They will perish, but you continue.</p>
<p class="q2">They all will grow old like a garment does.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>You will roll them up like a mantle,</p>
<p class="q2">and they will be changed;</p>
<p class="q">but you are the same.</p>
<p class="q2">Your years will not fail.”<span class="x">+ Psalm 102:25-27</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>But which of the angels has he told at any time,</p>
<p class="q">“Sit at my right hand,</p>
<p class="q2">until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet?”<span class="x">+ Psalm 110:1</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Aren’t they all serving spirits, sent out to do service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?</p>
<p id="2" class="c">2</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were heard, lest perhaps we drift away. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense; <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation—which at the first having been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard; <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders, by various works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will? <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>For he didn’t subject the world to come, of which we speak, to angels. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>But one has somewhere testified, saying,</p>
<p class="q">“What is man, that you think of him?</p>
<p class="q2">Or the son of man, that you care for him?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>You made him a little lower than the angels.</p>
<p class="q2">You crowned him with glory and honor.<span class="f">+ TR adds “and set him over the works of your hands”</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>You have put all things in subjection under his feet.”<span class="x">+ Psalm 8:4-6</span></p>
<p class="p">For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we don’t see all things subjected to him, yet.
    <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many children to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,<span class="f">+ The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”</span><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>saying,</p>
<p class="q">“I will declare your name to my brothers.</p>
<p class="q2">Among of the congregation I will sing your praise.”<span class="x">+ Psalm 22:22</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Again, “I will put my trust in him.”<span class="x">+ Isaiah 8:17</span> Again, “Behold, here I am with the children whom God has given me.”<span class="x">+ Isaiah 8:18</span><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood, he also himself in the same way partook of the same, that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>and might deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>For most certainly, he doesn’t give help to angels, but he gives help to the offspring<span class="f">+ or, seed</span> of Abraham. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</p>
<p id="3" class="c">3</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus; <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who built the house has more honor than the house. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken, <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house; whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says,</p>
<p class="q">“Today if you will hear his voice,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion,</p>
<p class="q2">like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>where your fathers tested me by proving me,</p>
<p class="q2">and saw my deeds for forty years.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Therefore I was displeased with that generation,</p>
<p class="q2">and said, ‘They always err in their heart,</p>
<p class="q2">but they didn’t know my ways;’</p>
<p class="q"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>as I swore in my wrath,</p>
<p class="q2">‘They will not enter into my rest.’”<span class="x">+ Psalm 95:7-11</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God; <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called “today”; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end: <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>while it is said,</p>
<p class="q">“Today if you will hear his voice,</p>
<p class="q2">don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.”<span class="x">+ Psalm 95:7-8</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>For who, when they heard, rebelled? No, didn’t all those who came out of Egypt by Moses? <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>With whom was he displeased forty years? Wasn’t it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>To whom did he swear that they wouldn’t enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient? <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>We see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.</p>
<p id="4" class="c">4</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Let us fear therefore, lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have come short of a promise of entering into his rest. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they also did, but the word they heard didn’t profit them, because it wasn’t mixed with faith by those who heard. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as he has said, “As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest”;<span class="x">+ Psalm 95:11</span> although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>For he has said this somewhere about the seventh day, “God rested on the seventh day from all his works”;<span class="x">+ Genesis 2:2</span><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>and in this place again, “They will not enter into my rest.”<span class="x">+ Psalm 95:11</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter into it, and they to whom the good news was preached before failed to enter in because of disobedience, <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>he again defines a certain day, today, saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been said),</p>
<p class="q">“Today if you will hear his voice,</p>
<p class="q2">don’t harden your hearts.”<span class="x">+ Psalm 95:7-8</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from his. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him to whom we must give an account. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Having then a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold tightly to our confession. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>For we don’t have a high priest who can’t be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace for help in time of need.</p>
<p id="5" class="c">5</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, because he himself is also surrounded with weakness. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people, as well as for himself. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God, just like Aaron was. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>So also Christ didn’t glorify himself to be made a high priest, but it was he who said to him,</p>
<p class="q">“You are my Son.</p>
<p class="q2">Today I have become your father.”<span class="x">+ Psalm 2:7</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>As he says also in another place,</p>
<p class="q">“You are a priest forever,</p>
<p class="q2">after the order of Melchizedek.”<span class="x">+ Psalm 110:4</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear, <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation, <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>About him we have many words to say, and hard to interpret, seeing you have become dull of hearing. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>For although by this time you should be teachers, you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the revelations of God. You have come to need milk, and not solid food. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a baby. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>But solid food is for those who are full grown, who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil.</p>
<p id="6" class="c">6</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Therefore leaving the teaching of the first principles of Christ, let us press on to perfection—not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith toward God, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>This will we do, if God permits. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>For concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit, <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come, <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify the Son of God for themselves again, and put him to open shame. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>For the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it, and produces a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receives blessing from God; <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is rejected and near being cursed, whose end is to be burned.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you, and things that accompany salvation, even though we speak like this. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>For God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name, in that you served the saints, and still do serve them. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end, <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>that you won’t be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and perseverance inherited the promises. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no one greater, he swore by himself, <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>saying, “Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.”<span class="x">+ Genesis 22:17</span><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>For men indeed swear by a greater one, and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>In this way God, being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath; <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil; <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.</p>
<p id="7" class="c">7</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, “king of righteousness”, and then also “king of Salem”, which means “king of peace”; <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God), remains a priest continually. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Now consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the best plunder. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest’s office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though these have come out of the body of Abraham, <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted tithes from Abraham, and has blessed him who has the promises. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Here people who die receive tithes, but there one receives tithes of whom it is testified that he lives. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>We can say that through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes, <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>for he was yet in the body of his father when Melchizedek met him. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Now if there were perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron? <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made also in the law. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah, about which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>This is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest, <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>who has been made, not after the law of a fleshly commandment, but after the power of an endless life: <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>for it is testified,</p>
<p class="q">“You are a priest forever,</p>
<p class="q2">according to the order of Melchizedek.”<span class="x">+ Psalm 110:4</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and uselessness <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oath <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath), but he with an oath by him that says of him,</p>
<p class="q">“The Lord swore and will not change his mind,</p>
<p class="q2">‘You are a priest forever,</p>
<p class="q2">according to the order of Melchizedek.’”<span class="x">+ Psalm 110:4</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>By so much, Jesus has become the collateral of a better covenant. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are hindered from continuing by death. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>But he, because he lives forever, has his priesthood unchangeable. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>For such a high priest was fitting for us: holy, guiltless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>who doesn’t need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices daily, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For he did this once for all, when he offered up himself. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath which came after the law appoints a Son forever who has been perfected.</p>
<p id="8" class="c">8</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this. We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>a servant of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law; <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said, “See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.”<span class="x">+ Exodus 25:40</span><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which on better promises has been given as law. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>For finding fault with them, he said,</p>
<p class="q">“Behold,<span class="f">+ “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span> the days come”, says the Lord,</p>
<p class="q2">“that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;</p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers,</p>
<p class="q2">in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;</p>
<p class="q">for they didn’t continue in my covenant,</p>
<p class="q2">and I disregarded them,” says the Lord.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>“For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="q2">After those days,” says the Lord;</p>
<p class="q">“I will put my laws into their mind,</p>
<p class="q2">I will also write them on their heart.</p>
<p class="q">I will be their God,</p>
<p class="q2">and they will be my people.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>They will not teach every man his fellow citizen,<span class="f">+ TR reads “neighbor” instead of “fellow citizen”</span></p>
<p class="q2">and every man his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’</p>
<p class="q2">for all will know me,</p>
<p class="q2">from their least to their greatest.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness.</p>
<p class="q2">I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more.”<span class="x">+ Jeremiah 31:31-34</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>In that he says, “A new covenant”, he has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away.</p>

<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now indeed even the first<span class="f">+ TR adds “tabernacle”</span> covenant had ordinances of divine service, and an earthly sanctuary. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>For a tabernacle was prepared. In the first part were the lamp stand, the table, and the show bread; which is called the Holy Place. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>After the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies, <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant; <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, of which things we can’t speak now in detail. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services, <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the errors of the people. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>The Holy Spirit is indicating this, that the way into the Holy Place wasn’t yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing; <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>which is a symbol of the present age, where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable, concerning the conscience, of making the worshiper perfect; <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>being only (with meats and drinks and various washings) fleshly ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>But Christ having come as a high priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation, <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh: <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without defect to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, that those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>For where a last will and testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him who made it. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>For a will is in force where there has been death, for it is never in force while he who made it lives. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Therefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated without blood. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>saying, “This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.”<span class="x">+ Exodus 24:8</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in the same way with the blood. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>According to the law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>For Christ hasn’t entered into holy places made with hands, which are representations of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us; <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own, <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>or else he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the end of the ages, he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this, judgment, <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, without sin, to those who are eagerly waiting for him for salvation.</p>
<p id="10" class="c">10</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>For the law, having a shadow of the good to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Or else wouldn’t they have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins? <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>But in those sacrifices there is a yearly reminder of sins. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Therefore when he comes into the world, he says,</p>
<p class="q">“Sacrifice and offering you didn’t desire,</p>
<p class="q2">but you prepared a body for me.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.</p>
<p class="q2"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come (in the scroll of the book it is written of me)</p>
<p class="q2">to do your will, O God.’”<span class="x">+ Psalm 40:6-8</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Previously saying, “Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you didn’t desire, neither had pleasure in them” (those which are offered according to the law), <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>then he has said, “Behold, I have come to do your will.” He takes away the first, that he may establish the second, <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Every priest indeed stands day by day serving and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins, <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God; <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>from that time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>“This is the covenant that I will make with them:</p>
<p class="q2">‘After those days,’ says the Lord,</p>
<p class="q">‘I will put my laws on their heart,</p>
<p class="q2">I will also write them on their mind;’”<span class="x">+ Jeremiah 31:33</span></p>
<p class="p">then he says,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>“I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more.”<span class="x">+ Jeremiah 31:34</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus, <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>and having a great priest over God’s house, <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>let’s draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having our body washed with pure water, <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering; for he who promised is faithful.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good works, <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as you see the Day approaching. <span id="26" class="v">26 </span>For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins, <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>A man who disregards Moses’ law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>How much worse punishment do you think he will be judged worthy of who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace? <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>For we know him who said, “Vengeance belongs to me,” says the Lord, “I will repay.”<span class="x">+ Deuteronomy 32:35</span> Again, “The Lord will judge his people.”<span class="x">+ Deuteronomy 32:36; Psalm 135:14</span><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. <span id="32" class="v">32 </span>But remember the former days, in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings; <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>partly, being exposed to both reproaches and oppressions; and partly, becoming partakers with those who were treated so. <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>For you both had compassion on me in my chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens. <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>Therefore don’t throw away your boldness, which has a great reward. <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>For you need endurance so that, having done the will of God, you may receive the promise.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>“In a very little while,</p>
<p class="q2">he who comes will come, and will not wait.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="38" class="v">38 </span>But the righteous will live by faith.</p>
<p class="q2">If he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.”<span class="x">+ Habakkuk 2:3-4</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="39" class="v">39 </span>But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul.</p>
<p id="11" class="c">11</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, proof of things not seen. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>For by this, the elders obtained testimony. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>By faith, we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>By faith, Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous, God testifying with respect to his gifts; and through it he, being dead, still speaks. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>By faith, Enoch was taken away, so that he wouldn’t see death, and he was not found, because God translated him. For he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>By faith, Noah, being warned about things not yet seen, moved with godly fear,<span class="f">+ or, reverence</span> prepared a ship for the saving of his house, through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>By faith, Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inheritance. He went out, not knowing where he went. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>By faith, he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>For he looked for the city which has the foundations, whose builder and maker is God. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>By faith, even Sarah herself received power to conceive, and she bore a child when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore, were fathered by one man, and him as good as dead. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen<span class="f">+ TR adds “and being convinced of”</span> them and embraced them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had enough time to return. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>By faith, Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son, <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>to whom it was said, “your offspring<span class="f">+ or, seed</span> will be accounted as from Isaac”;<span class="x">+ Genesis 21:12</span><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead.

<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Therefore let us also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>For consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, that you don’t grow weary, fainting in your souls. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin; <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children,</p>
