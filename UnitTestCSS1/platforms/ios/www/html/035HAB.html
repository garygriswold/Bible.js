<p class="mt2">The Book of</p>
<p class="mt">Habakkuk</p>
<p id="1" class="c">1</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The revelation which Habakkuk the prophet saw. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Yahweh,<span class="f">+ “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.</span> how long will I cry, and you will not hear? I cry out to you “Violence!” and will you not save? <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Why do you show me iniquity, and look at perversity? For destruction and violence are before me. There is strife, and contention rises up. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails; for the wicked surround the righteous; therefore justice comes out perverted.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>“Look among the nations, watch, and wonder marvelously; for I am working a work in your days, which you will not believe though it is told you. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>For, behold,<span class="f">+ “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span> I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the width of the earth, to possess dwelling places that are not theirs. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>They are feared and dreaded. Their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves. Their horsemen press proudly on. Yes, their horsemen come from afar. They fly as an eagle that hurries to devour. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>All of them come for violence. Their hordes face the desert. He gathers prisoners like sand. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Yes, he scoffs at kings, and princes are a derision to him. He laughs at every stronghold, for he builds up an earthen ramp, and takes it. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Then he sweeps by like the wind, and goes on. He is indeed guilty, whose strength is his god.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Aren’t you from everlasting, Yahweh my God,<span class="f">+ The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</span> my Holy One? We will not die. Yahweh, you have appointed him for judgment. You, Rock, have established him to punish. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>You who have purer eyes than to see evil, and who cannot look on perversity, why do you tolerate those who deal treacherously, and keep silent when the wicked swallows up the man who is more righteous than he, <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>and make men like the fish of the sea, like the creeping things, that have no ruler over them? <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>He takes up all of them with the hook. He catches them in his net, and gathers them in his dragnet. Therefore he rejoices and is glad. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Therefore he sacrifices to his net, and burns incense to his dragnet, because by them his life is luxurious, and his food is good. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Will he therefore continually empty his net, and kill the nations without mercy?</p>
<p id="2" class="c">2</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>I will stand at my watch, and set myself on the ramparts, and will look out to see what he will say to me, and what I will answer concerning my complaint.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Yahweh answered me, “Write the vision, and make it plain on tablets, that he who runs may read it. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it hurries toward the end, and won’t prove false. Though it takes time, wait for it; because it will surely come. It won’t delay. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Behold, his soul is puffed up. It is not upright in him, but the righteous will live by his faith. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Yes, moreover, wine is treacherous. A haughty man who doesn’t stay at home, who enlarges his desire as Sheol,<span class="f">+ Sheol is the place of the dead.</span> and he is like death, and can’t be satisfied, but gathers to himself all nations, and heaps to himself all peoples. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Won’t all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, ‘Woe to him who increases that which is not his, and who enriches himself by extortion! How long?’ <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Won’t your debtors rise up suddenly, and wake up those who make you tremble, and you will be their victim? <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you, because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell in it. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil! <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>You have devised shame to your house, by cutting off many peoples, and have sinned against your soul. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>For the stone will cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the woodwork will answer it. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Woe to him who builds a town with blood, and establishes a city by iniquity! <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Behold, isn’t it of Yahweh of Armies that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity? <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Yahweh’s glory, as the waters cover the sea.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>“Woe to him who gives his neighbor drink, pouring your inflaming wine until they are drunk, so that you may gaze at their naked bodies! <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>You are filled with shame, and not glory. You will also drink, and be exposed! The cup of Yahweh’s right hand will come around to you, and disgrace will cover your glory. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and the destruction of the animals, which made them afraid; because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to every city and to those who dwell in them.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>“What value does the engraved image have, that its maker has engraved it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he who fashions its form trusts in it, to make mute idols? <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Woe to him who says to the wood, ‘Awake!’ or to the mute stone, ‘Arise!’ Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all within it. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>But Yahweh is in his holy temple. Let all the earth be silent before him!”</p>

<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>A prayer of Habakkuk, the prophet, set to victorious music.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Yahweh, I have heard of your fame.</p>
<p class="q2">I stand in awe of your deeds, Yahweh.</p>
<p class="q">Renew your work in the middle of the years.</p>
<p class="q2">In the middle of the years make it known.</p>
<p class="q2">In wrath, you remember mercy.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>God came from Teman,</p>
<p class="q2">the Holy One from Mount Paran. <span class="qs">Selah.</span></p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q">His glory covered the heavens,</p>
<p class="q2">and his praise filled the earth.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>His splendor is like the sunrise.</p>
<p class="q2">Rays shine from his hand, where his power is hidden.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Plague went before him,</p>
<p class="q2">and pestilence followed his feet.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>He stood, and shook the earth.</p>
<p class="q2">He looked, and made the nations tremble.</p>
<p class="q2">The ancient mountains were crumbled.</p>
<p class="q2">The age-old hills collapsed.</p>
<p class="q2">His ways are eternal.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction.</p>
<p class="q2">The dwellings of the land of Midian trembled.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Was Yahweh displeased with the rivers?</p>
<p class="q2">Was your anger against the rivers,</p>
<p class="q2">or your wrath against the sea,</p>
<p class="q2">that you rode on your horses,</p>
<p class="q2">on your chariots of salvation?</p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>You uncovered your bow.</p>
<p class="q2">You called for your sworn arrows. <span class="qs">Selah.</span></p>
<p class="q">You split the earth with rivers.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>The mountains saw you, and were afraid.</p>
<p class="q2">The storm of waters passed by.</p>
<p class="q2">The deep roared and lifted up its hands on high.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>The sun and moon stood still in the sky,</p>
<p class="q2">at the light of your arrows as they went,</p>
<p class="q2">at the shining of your glittering spear.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>You marched through the land in wrath.</p>
<p class="q2">You threshed the nations in anger.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>You went out for the salvation of your people,</p>
<p class="q2">for the salvation of your anointed.</p>
<p class="q">You crushed the head of the land of wickedness.</p>
<p class="q2">You stripped them head to foot. <span class="qs">Selah.</span></p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>You pierced the heads of his warriors with their own spears.</p>
<p class="q2">They came as a whirlwind to scatter me,</p>
<p class="q2">gloating as if to devour the wretched in secret.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>You trampled the sea with your horses,</p>
<p class="q2">churning mighty waters.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>I heard, and my body trembled.</p>
<p class="q2">My lips quivered at the voice.</p>
<p class="q">Rottenness enters into my bones, and I tremble in my place,</p>
<p class="q2">because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble,</p>
<p class="q2">for the coming up of the people who invade us.</p>
<p class="q"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>For though the fig tree doesn’t flourish,</p>
<p class="q2">nor fruit be in the vines;</p>
<p class="q2">the labor of the olive fails,</p>
<p class="q2">the fields yield no food;</p>
<p class="q2">the flocks are cut off from the fold,</p>
<p class="q2">and there is no herd in the stalls:</p>
<p class="q"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>yet I will rejoice in Yahweh.</p>
<p class="q2">I will be joyful in the God of my salvation!</p>
<p class="q"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Yahweh, the Lord,<span class="f">+ The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”</span> is my strength.</p>
