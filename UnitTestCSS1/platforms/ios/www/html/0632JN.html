<p class="mt">John’s Second Letter</p>
<p id="1" class="c">1</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all those who know the truth; <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>for the truth’s sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever: <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don’t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Watch yourselves, that we don’t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Whoever transgresses and doesn’t remain in the teaching of Christ, doesn’t have God. He who remains in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>If anyone comes to you, and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t receive him into your house, and don’t welcome him, <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>for he who welcomes him participates in his evil deeds.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Having many things to write to you, I don’t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.</p>
