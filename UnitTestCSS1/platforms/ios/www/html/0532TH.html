<p class="mt">Paul’s Second Letter to the Thessalonians</p>
<p id="1" class="c">1</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ: <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>We are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers,<span class="f">+ The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”</span> even as it is appropriate, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each and every one of you towards one another abounds; <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God for your perseverance and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>This is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God, to the end that you may be counted worthy of God’s Kingdom, for which you also suffer. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Since it is a righteous thing with God to repay affliction to those who afflict you, <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>punishing those who don’t know God, and to those who don’t obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus, <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>who will pay the penalty: eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might, <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>when he comes in that day to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired among all those who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>To this end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith, with power; <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>that the name of our Lord Jesus<span class="f">+ TR adds “Christ”</span> may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="2" class="c">2</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together to him, we ask you <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>not to be quickly shaken in your mind, and not be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by letter as if from us, saying that the day of Christ has already come. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Let no one deceive you in any way. For it will not be, unless the rebellion<span class="f">+ or,<span class="fqa">falling away</span><span class="ft">, or, </span><span class="fqa">defection</span></span> comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of destruction, <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>he who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped; so that he sits as God in the temple of God, setting himself up as God. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Don’t you remember that, when I was still with you, I told you these things? <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Now you know what is restraining him, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>For the mystery of lawlessness already works. Only there is one who restrains now, until he is taken out of the way. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth, and destroy by the manifestation of his coming; <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>even he whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>and with all deception of wickedness for those who are being lost, because they didn’t receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Because of this, God sends them a working of error, that they should believe a lie; <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>that they all might be judged who didn’t believe the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>But we are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief in the truth; <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>to which he called you through our Good News, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>So then, brothers, stand firm, and hold the traditions which you were taught by us, whether by word, or by letter.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace, <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work and word.</p>
<p id="3" class="c">3</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified, even as also with you; <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for not all have faith. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you, and guard you from the evil one. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you both do and will do the things we command. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>May the Lord direct your hearts into God’s love, and into the perseverance of Christ.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks in rebellion, and not after the tradition which they received from us. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>For you know how you ought to imitate us. For we didn’t behave ourselves rebelliously among you, <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>neither did we eat bread from anyone’s hand without paying for it, but in labor and travail worked night and day, that we might not burden any of you; <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>not because we don’t have the right, but to make ourselves an example to you, that you should imitate us. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: “If anyone will not work, don’t let him eat.” <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>For we hear of some who walk among you in rebellion, who don’t work at all, but are busybodies. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Now those who are that way, we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>But you, brothers, don’t be weary in doing what is right. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>If any man doesn’t obey our word in this letter, note that man, that you have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Don’t count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>The greeting of me, Paul, with my own hand, which is the sign in every letter: this is how I write. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</p>
