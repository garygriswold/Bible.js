<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ,<span class="f">+ Messiah (Hebrew) and Christ (Greek) both mean “Anointed One”</span> the son of David, the son of Abraham. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Abraham became the father of Isaac. Isaac became the father of Jacob. Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Perez became the father of Hezron. Hezron became the father of Ram. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Ram became the father of Amminadab. Amminadab became the father of Nahshon. Nahshon became the father of Salmon. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab. Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth. Obed became the father of Jesse. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Jesse became the father of King David. David became the father of Solomon by her who had been Uriah’s wife. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Solomon became the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam became the father of Abijah. Abijah became the father of Asa. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Asa became the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram. Joram became the father of Uzziah. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Uzziah became the father of Jotham. Jotham became the father of Ahaz. Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh. Manasseh became the father of Amon. Amon became the father of Josiah. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the exile to Babylon. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud. Abiud became the father of Eliakim. Eliakim became the father of Azor. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Azor became the father of Zadok. Zadok became the father of Achim. Achim became the father of Eliud. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Eliud became the father of Eleazar. Eleazar became the father of Matthan. Matthan became the father of Jacob. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Jacob became the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus,<span class="f">+ “Jesus” means “Salvation”.</span> who is called Christ. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ, fourteen generations.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: After his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>But when he thought about these things, behold,<span class="f">+ “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span> an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take to yourself Mary, your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>She shall give birth to a son. You shall call his name Jesus,<span class="f">+ “Jesus” means “Salvation”.</span> for it is he who shall save his people from their sins.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>“Behold, the virgin shall be with child,</p>
<p class="q2">and shall give birth to a son.</p>
<p class="q">They shall call his name Immanuel”;</p>
<p class="q2">which is, being interpreted, “God with us.”<span class="x">+ Isaiah 7:14</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself; <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>and didn’t know her sexually until she had given birth to her firstborn son. He named him Jesus.</p>
<p id="2" class="c">2</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men<span class="f">+ The word for “wise men” (magoi) can also mean teachers, scientists, physicians, astrologers, seers, interpreters of dreams, or sorcerers.</span> from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.” <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>When King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be born. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written through the prophet,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="6" class="v">6 </span>‘You Bethlehem, land of Judah,</p>
<p class="q2">are in no way least among the princes of Judah:</p>
<p class="q">for out of you shall come a governor,</p>
<p class="q2">who shall shepherd my people, Israel.’”<span class="x">+ Micah 5:2</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them exactly what time the star appeared. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>He sent them to Bethlehem, and said, “Go and search diligently for the young child. When you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was. <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>They came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Being warned in a dream that they shouldn’t return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>He arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt, <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>and was there until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”<span class="x">+ Hosea 11:1</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent out, and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learned from the wise men. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>“A voice was heard in Ramah,</p>
<p class="q2">lamentation, weeping and great mourning,</p>
<p class="q">Rachel weeping for her children;</p>
<p class="q2">she wouldn’t be comforted,</p>
<p class="q2">because they are no more.”<span class="x">+ Jeremiah 31:15</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>“Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the young child’s life are dead.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>He arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee, <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>and came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”</p>
<p id="3" class="c">3</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>In those days, John the Baptizer came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!” <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="q">“The voice of one crying in the wilderness,</p>
<p class="q2">make ready the way of the Lord.</p>
<p class="q2">Make his paths straight.”<span class="x">+ Isaiah 40:3</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Now John himself wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>They were baptized<span class="f">+ or, immersed</span> by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism,<span class="f">+ or, immersion</span> he said to them, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance! <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>Don’t think to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father,’ for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>“Even now the ax lies at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>I indeed baptize<span class="f">+ or, immerse</span> you in water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.<span class="f">+ TR and NU add “and with fire”</span><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan<span class="f">+ i.e., the Jordan River</span> to John, to be baptized by him. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>But John would have hindered him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>But Jesus, answering, said to him, <span class="wj">“Allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness.”</span> Then he allowed him. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming on him. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Behold, a voice out of the heavens said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”</p>
<p id="4" class="c">4</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry afterward. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>But he answered, <span class="wj">“It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.’”</span><span class="x">+ Deuteronomy 8:3</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>Then the devil took him into the holy city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple, <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, ‘He will put his angels in charge of you.’ and,</p>
<p class="q">‘On their hands they will bear you up,</p>
<p class="q2">so that you don’t dash your foot against a stone.’”<span class="x">+ Psalm 91:11-12</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Again, it is written, ‘You shall not test the Lord, your God.’”</span><span class="x">+ Deuteronomy 6:16</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>He said to him, “I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Then Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Get behind me,</span><span class="f">+ TR and NU read “Go away” instead of “Get behind me”</span><span class="wj">Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.’”</span><span class="x">+ Deuteronomy 6:13</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali, <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>“The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,</p>
<p class="q2">toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,</p>
<p class="q2">Galilee of the Gentiles,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>the people who sat in darkness saw a great light,</p>
<p class="q2">to those who sat in the region and shadow of death,</p>
<p class="q2">to them light has dawned.”<span class="x">+ Isaiah 9:1-2</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>From that time, Jesus began to preach, and to say, <span class="wj">“Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Walking by the sea of Galilee, he<span class="f">+ TR reads “Jesus” instead of “he”</span>  saw two brothers: Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. <span id="19" class="v">19 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Come after me, and I will make you fishers for men.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>They immediately left their nets and followed him. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>They immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>The report about him went out into all Syria. They brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed them. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Great multitudes from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and from beyond the Jordan followed him.</p>
<p id="5" class="c">5</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to him. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>He opened his mouth and taught them, saying,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span><span class="wj">“Blessed are the poor in spirit,</span></p>

<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span><span class="wj">“You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men. </span><span id="14" class="v">14 </span><span class="wj">You are the light of the world.

<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>He set another parable before them, saying, <span class="wj">“The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field, </span><span id="25" class="v">25 </span><span class="wj">but while people slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel weeds</span><span class="f">+ darnel is a weed grass (probably bearded darnel or lolium temulentum) that looks very much like wheat until it is mature, when the difference becomes very apparent.</span><span class="wj">also among the wheat, and went away. </span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span><span class="wj">But when the blade sprang up and produced fruit, then the darnel weeds appeared also. </span><span id="27" class="v">27 </span><span class="wj">The servants of the householder came and said to him, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where did these darnel weeds come from?’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span><span class="wj">“He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’</span></p>
<p class="p"><span class="wj">“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and gather them up?’ </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span><span class="wj">“But he said, ‘No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with them. </span><span id="30" class="v">30 </span><span class="wj">Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers, “First, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>He set another parable before them, saying, <span class="wj">“The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field; </span><span id="32" class="v">32 </span><span class="wj">which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>He spoke another parable to them. <span class="wj">“The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast, which a woman took, and hid in three measures</span><span class="f">+ literally, three sata 3 sata is about 39 liters or a bit more than a bushel</span><span class="wj">of meal, until it was all leavened.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he didn’t speak to them, <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="q">“I will open my mouth in parables;</p>
<p class="q2">I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.”<span class="x">+ Psalm 78:2</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>Then Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the house. His disciples came to him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>He answered them, <span class="wj">“He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man, </span><span id="38" class="v">38 </span><span class="wj">the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the children of the Kingdom; and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one. </span><span id="39" class="v">39 </span><span class="wj">The enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. </span><span id="40" class="v">40 </span><span class="wj">As therefore the darnel weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be at the end of this age. </span><span id="41" class="v">41 </span><span class="wj">The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and those who do iniquity, </span><span id="42" class="v">42 </span><span class="wj">and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth. </span><span id="43" class="v">43 </span><span class="wj">Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="44" class="v">44 </span><span class="wj">“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in the field, which a man found, and hid. In his joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="45" class="v">45 </span><span class="wj">“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls, </span><span id="46" class="v">46 </span><span class="wj">who having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="47" class="v">47 </span><span class="wj">“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet, that was cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of every kind, </span><span id="48" class="v">48 </span><span class="wj">which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach. They sat down, and gathered the good into containers, but the bad they threw away. </span><span id="49" class="v">49 </span><span class="wj">So will it be in the end of the world.<span class="f">+<span class="fr">13:49 </span><span class="ft">or, end of the age.</span></span> The angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous, </span><span id="50" class="v">50 </span><span class="wj">and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.”</span><span id="51" class="v">51 </span>Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“Have you understood all these things?” </span></p>
<p class="p">They answered him, “Yes, Lord.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="52" class="v">52 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Therefore every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old things.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="53" class="v">53 </span>When Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there. <span id="54" class="v">54 </span>Coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom, and these mighty works? <span id="55" class="v">55 </span>Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James, Joses, Simon, and Judas?<span class="f">+ or, Judah</span><span id="56" class="v">56 </span>Aren’t all of his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all of these things?” <span id="57" class="v">57 </span>They were offended by him.</p>
<p class="p">But Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house.”</span><span id="58" class="v">58 </span>He didn’t do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</p>
<p id="14" class="c">14</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptizer. He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him.” <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>For Herod had laid hold of John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>For John said to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.” <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>When he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask. <span id="8" class="v">8 </span>She, being prompted by her mother, said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptizer.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span>The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given, <span id="10" class="v">10 </span>and he sent and beheaded John in the prison. <span id="11" class="v">11 </span>His head was brought on a platter, and given to the young lady: and she brought it to her mother. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>His disciples came, and took the body, and buried it; and they went and told Jesus. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place apart. When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>Jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them, and healed their sick. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>When evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying, “This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>But Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“They don’t need to go away. You give them something to eat.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>They told him, “We only have here five loaves and two fish.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>He said, <span class="wj">“Bring them here to me.”</span><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>They all ate, and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. <span id="23" class="v">23 </span>After he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone. <span id="24" class="v">24 </span>But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary. <span id="25" class="v">25 </span>In the fourth watch of the night,<span class="f">+ The night was equally divided into four watches, so the fourth watch is approximately 3:00 a.m. to sunrise.</span> Jesus came to them, walking on the sea.<span class="x">+ see Job 9:8</span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, “It’s a ghost!” and they cried out for fear. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span class="wj">“Cheer up! It is I! </span><span class="f">+ or, I AM!</span><span class="wj">Don’t be afraid.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Peter answered him and said, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>He said, <span class="wj">“Come!”</span></p>
<p class="p">Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to Jesus.
    <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>But when he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, <span class="wj">“You of little faith, why did you doubt?”</span><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>Those who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, “You are truly the Son of God!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret. <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>When the people of that place recognized him, they sent into all that surrounding region, and brought to him all who were sick; <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe<span class="f">+ or, tassel</span> of his garment. As many as touched it were made whole.</p>
<p id="15" class="c">15</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying, <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>“Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat bread.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="3" class="v">3 </span>He answered them, <span class="wj">“Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition? </span><span id="4" class="v">4 </span><span class="wj">For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’</span><span class="x">+ Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16</span><span class="wj">and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’</span><span class="x">+ Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9</span><span id="5" class="v">5 </span><span class="wj">But you say, ‘Whoever may tell his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,” </span><span id="6" class="v">6 </span><span class="wj">he shall not honor his father or mother.’ You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition. </span><span id="7" class="v">7 </span><span class="wj">You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</span></p>
<p class="q"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span><span class="wj">‘These people draw near to me with their mouth,</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">and honor me with their lips;</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">but their heart is far from me.</span></p>
<p class="q"><span id="9" class="v">9 </span><span class="wj">And in vain do they worship me,</span></p>
<p class="q2"><span class="wj">teaching as doctrine rules made by men.’”</span><span class="x">+ Isaiah 29:13</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>He summoned the multitude, and said to them, <span class="wj">“Hear, and understand. </span><span id="11" class="v">11 </span><span class="wj">That which enters into the mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Then the disciples came, and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="13" class="v">13 </span>But he answered, <span class="wj">“Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted. </span><span id="14" class="v">14 </span><span class="wj">Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Peter answered him, “Explain the parable to us.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>So Jesus said, <span class="wj">“Do you also still not understand? </span><span id="17" class="v">17 </span><span class="wj">Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body? </span><span id="18" class="v">18 </span><span class="wj">But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man. </span><span id="19" class="v">19 </span><span class="wj">For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies. </span><span id="20" class="v">20 </span><span class="wj">These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the man.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="21" class="v">21 </span>Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon. <span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>But he answered her not a word.</p>
<p class="p">His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries after us.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>But he answered, <span class="wj">“I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>But she came and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>But he answered, <span class="wj">“It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="28" class="v">28 </span>Then Jesus answered her, <span class="wj">“Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.”</span> And her daughter was healed from that hour.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="29" class="v">29 </span>Jesus departed from there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there. <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them, <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, the injured healed, the lame walking, and the blind seeing—and they glorified the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>Jesus summoned his disciples and said, <span class="wj">“I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>The disciples said to him, “Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“How many loaves do you have?”</span></p>
<p class="p">They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground; <span id="36" class="v">36 </span>and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>They all ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over. <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. <span id="39" class="v">39 </span>Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.</p>
<p id="16" class="c">16</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>But he answered them, <span class="wj">“When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’ </span><span id="3" class="v">3 </span><span class="wj">In the morning, ‘It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can’t discern the signs of the times! </span><span id="4" class="v">4 </span><span class="wj">An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah.”</span></p>
<p class="p">He left them, and departed.
    <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="7" class="v">7 </span>They reasoned among themselves, saying, “We brought no bread.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>Jesus, perceiving it, said, <span class="wj">“Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, ‘because you have brought no bread?’ </span><span id="9" class="v">9 </span><span class="wj">Don’t you yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up? </span><span id="10" class="v">10 </span><span class="wj">Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up? </span><span id="11" class="v">11 </span><span class="wj">How is it that you don’t perceive that I didn’t speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>Then they understood that he didn’t tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, <span class="wj">“Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>They said, “Some say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“But who do you say that I am?”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Jesus answered him, <span class="wj">“Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. </span><span id="18" class="v">18 </span><span class="wj">I also tell you that you are Peter,</span><span class="f">+ Peter’s name, Petros in Greek, is the word for a specific rock or stone.</span><span class="wj">and on this rock </span><span class="f">+ Greek, petra, a rock mass or bedrock.</span><span class="wj">I will build my assembly, and the gates of Hades</span><span class="f">+ or, Hell</span><span class="wj">will not prevail against it. </span><span id="19" class="v">19 </span><span class="wj">I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven.”</span><span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Then he commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Peter took him aside, and began to rebuke him, saying, “Far be it from you, Lord! This will never be done to you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>But he turned, and said to Peter, <span class="wj">“Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.”</span><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>Then Jesus said to his disciples, <span class="wj">“If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. </span><span id="25" class="v">25 </span><span class="wj">For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it. </span><span id="26" class="v">26 </span><span class="wj">For what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life? </span><span id="27" class="v">27 </span><span class="wj">For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to everyone according to his deeds. </span><span id="28" class="v">28 </span><span class="wj">Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.” </span></p>
<p id="17" class="c">17</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="4" class="v">4 </span>Peter answered, and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let’s make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.”</p>

<p class="p"><span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter whom you teach, for you aren’t partial to anyone. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Tell us therefore, what do you think?

<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>However, knowing this, Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“Why do you trouble the woman?

<p class="p"><span id="17" class="v">17 </span>Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="18" class="v">18 </span>He said, <span class="wj">“Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.”’”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>The disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover. <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Now when evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>As they were eating, he said, <span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him, “It isn’t me, is it, Lord?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>He answered, <span class="wj">“He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me. </span><span id="24" class="v">24 </span><span class="wj">The Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed!

<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>Judas, who betrayed him, answered, “It isn’t me, is it, Rabbi?”</p>
<p class="p">He said to him, <span class="wj">“You said it.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for<span class="f">+ TR reads “blessed” instead of “gave thanks for”</span> it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples, and said, <span class="wj">“Take, eat; this is my body.”</span><span id="27" class="v">27 </span>He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, <span class="wj">“All of you drink it, </span><span id="28" class="v">28 </span><span class="wj">for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins. </span><span id="29" class="v">29 </span><span class="wj">But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father’s Kingdom.” </span><span id="30" class="v">30 </span>When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="31" class="v">31 </span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’</span><span class="x">+ Zechariah 13:7</span><span id="32" class="v">32 </span><span class="wj">But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="33" class="v">33 </span>But Peter answered him, “Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="34" class="v">34 </span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="35" class="v">35 </span>Peter said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” All of the disciples also said likewise.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, <span class="wj">“Sit here, while I go there and pray.”</span><span id="37" class="v">37 </span>He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled. <span id="38" class="v">38 </span>Then he said to them, <span class="wj">“My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="39" class="v">39 </span>He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, <span class="wj">“My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="40" class="v">40 </span>He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, <span class="wj">“What, couldn’t you watch with me for one hour? </span><span id="41" class="v">41 </span><span class="wj">Watch and pray, that you don’t enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="42" class="v">42 </span>Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, <span class="wj">“My Father, if this cup can’t pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done.” </span><span id="43" class="v">43 </span>He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. <span id="44" class="v">44 </span>He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words. <span id="45" class="v">45 </span>Then he came to his disciples, and said to them, <span class="wj">“Sleep on now, and take your rest.

Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="47" class="v">47 </span>While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people. <span id="48" class="v">48 </span>Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, “Whoever I kiss, he is the one.

<p class="p"><span id="50" class="v">50 </span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Friend, why are you here?”</span> Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. <span id="51" class="v">51 </span>Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear. <span id="52" class="v">52 </span>Then Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword. </span><span id="53" class="v">53 </span><span class="wj">Or do you think that I couldn’t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels? </span><span id="54" class="v">54 </span><span class="wj">How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?” </span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="55" class="v">55 </span>In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, <span class="wj">“Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me. </span><span id="56" class="v">56 </span><span class="wj">But all this has happened, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”</span></p>
<p class="p">Then all the disciples left him, and fled.
    <span id="57" class="v">57 </span>Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together. <span id="58" class="v">58 </span>But Peter followed him from a distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end. <span id="59" class="v">59 </span>Now the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death; <span id="60" class="v">60 </span>and they found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward, <span id="61" class="v">61 </span>and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.’”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="62" class="v">62 </span>The high priest stood up, and said to him, “Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?” <span id="63" class="v">63 </span>But Jesus held his peace. The high priest answered him, “I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="64" class="v">64 </span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="65" class="v">65 </span>Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy. <span id="66" class="v">66 </span>What do you think?”</p>
<p class="p">They answered, “He is worthy of death!”
    <span id="67" class="v">67 </span>Then they spat in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him, <span id="68" class="v">68 </span>saying, “Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who hit you?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="69" class="v">69 </span>Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, “You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="70" class="v">70 </span>But he denied it before them all, saying, “I don’t know what you are talking about.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="71" class="v">71 </span>When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there, “This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="72" class="v">72 </span>Again he denied it with an oath, “I don’t know the man.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="73" class="v">73 </span>After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, “Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="74" class="v">74 </span>Then he began to curse and to swear, “I don’t know the man!”</p>
<p class="p">Immediately the rooster crowed.
    <span id="75" class="v">75 </span>Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him, <span class="wj">“Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</span> He went out and wept bitterly.</p>
<p id="27" class="c">27</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>saying, “I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.”</p>
<p class="p">But they said, “What is that to us? You see to it.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="5" class="v">5 </span>He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed.

<p class="q">“They took the thirty pieces of silver,</p>
<p class="q2">the price of him upon whom a price had been set,</p>
<p class="q2">whom some of the children of Israel priced,</p>
<p class="q"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>and they gave them for the potter’s field,</p>
<p class="q2">as the Lord commanded me.”<span class="x">+ Zechariah 11:12-13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?”</p>
<p class="p">Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“So you say.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="12" class="v">12 </span>When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many things they testify against you?”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="14" class="v">14 </span>He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly. <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired. <span id="16" class="v">16 </span>They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?” <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="19" class="v">19 </span>While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of him.” <span id="20" class="v">20 </span>Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. <span id="21" class="v">21 </span>But the governor answered them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?”</p>
<p class="p">They said, “Barabbas!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="22" class="v">22 </span>Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?”</p>
<p class="p">They all said to him, “Let him be crucified!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="23" class="v">23 </span>But the governor said, “Why? What evil has he done?”</p>
<p class="p">But they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Let him be crucified!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="24" class="v">24 </span>So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="25" class="v">25 </span>All the people answered, “May his blood be on us, and on our children!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="26" class="v">26 </span>Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified. <span id="27" class="v">27 </span>Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him. <span id="28" class="v">28 </span>They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him. <span id="29" class="v">29 </span>They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” <span id="30" class="v">30 </span>They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head. <span id="31" class="v">31 </span>When they had mocked him, they took the robe off him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="32" class="v">32 </span>As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross. <span id="33" class="v">33 </span>When they came to a place called “Golgotha”, that is to say, “The place of a skull,” <span id="34" class="v">34 </span>they gave him sour wine<span class="f">+ or, vinegar</span> to drink mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink. <span id="35" class="v">35 </span>When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,<span class="f">+ TR adds “that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet: ‘They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots;’” [see Psalm 22:18 and John 19:24]</span><span id="36" class="v">36 </span>and they sat and watched him there. <span id="37" class="v">37 </span>They set up over his head the accusation against him written, “THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="38" class="v">38 </span>Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left. <span id="39" class="v">39 </span>Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, <span id="40" class="v">40 </span>and saying, “You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="41" class="v">41 </span>Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes, the Pharisees,<span class="f">+ TR omits “the Pharisees”</span> and the elders, said, <span id="42" class="v">42 </span>“He saved others, but he can’t save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him. <span id="43" class="v">43 </span>He trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’” <span id="44" class="v">44 </span>The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="45" class="v">45 </span>Now from the sixth hour<span class="f">+ noon</span> there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.<span class="f">+ 3:00 p.m.</span><span id="46" class="v">46 </span>About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <span class="wj">“Eli, Eli, lima</span><span class="f">+ TR reads “lama” instead of “lima”</span><span class="wj">sabachthani?” </span> That is, <span class="wj">“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</span><span class="x">+ Psalm 22:1</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="47" class="v">47 </span>Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="48" class="v">48 </span>Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink. <span id="49" class="v">49 </span>The rest said, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="50" class="v">50 </span>Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit. <span id="51" class="v">51 </span>Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split. <span id="52" class="v">52 </span>The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; <span id="53" class="v">53 </span>and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many. <span id="54" class="v">54 </span>Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, “Truly this was the Son of God.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="55" class="v">55 </span>Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him. <span id="56" class="v">56 </span>Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. <span id="57" class="v">57 </span>When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself was also Jesus’ disciple came. <span id="58" class="v">58 </span>This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up. <span id="59" class="v">59 </span>Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, <span id="60" class="v">60 </span>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone against the door of the tomb, and departed. <span id="61" class="v">61 </span>Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb. <span id="62" class="v">62 </span>Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate, <span id="63" class="v">63 </span>saying, “Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will rise again.’ <span id="64" class="v">64 </span>Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He is risen from the dead;’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="65" class="v">65 </span>Pilate said to them, “You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can.” <span id="66" class="v">66 </span>So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone.</p>
<p id="28" class="c">28</p>
<p class="p"><span id="1" class="v">1 </span>Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. <span id="2" class="v">2 </span>Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it. <span id="3" class="v">3 </span>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. <span id="4" class="v">4 </span>For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men. <span id="5" class="v">5 </span>The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified. <span id="6" class="v">6 </span>He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying. <span id="7" class="v">7 </span>Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.”</p>
<p class="p"><span id="8" class="v">8 </span>They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word. <span id="9" class="v">9 </span>As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, <span class="wj">“Rejoice!”</span></p>
<p class="p">They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="10" class="v">10 </span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“Don’t be afraid. Go tell my brothers </span><span class="f">+ The word for “brothers” here may be also correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”</span><span class="wj">that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span id="11" class="v">11 </span>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened. <span id="12" class="v">12 </span>When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers, <span id="13" class="v">13 </span>saying, “Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. <span id="14" class="v">14 </span>If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.” <span id="15" class="v">15 </span>So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until today.</p>
<p class="p"><span id="16" class="v">16 </span>But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them. <span id="17" class="v">17 </span>When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted. <span id="18" class="v">18 </span>Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, <span class="wj">“All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. </span><span id="19" class="v">19 </span><span class="wj">Go</span><span class="f">+ TR and NU add “therefore”</span><span class="wj">and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, </span><span id="20" class="v">20 </span><span class="wj">teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”</span> Amen.</p>
