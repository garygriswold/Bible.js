Most of these contained very obvious errors that might have been caused by accidental editing,
or by saving the file using a program that used an incompatible character encoding.
All of the above were manually corrected on copies of info.json stored on my laptop.

Most files contained one or two errors, but KDJSBU contain a very large number of identical errors.

LSIBSM contained Bible book names with embedded double and single quotes. I escaped them using commas as a guide.

Differences:

haiola_id == id in every case except ENGESV, where it is absent
type == 'bible' in every file
name is absent for BULB40
nameEnglish is absent for ENGESV
hasLemma is absent from ENGESV
abbr is always equal to id
dir is always ltr or rtl
lang is sometimes uppercase and sometimes lowercase
lang is different that id[0:3] only 26 times
fontClass is absent for ENGESV
script is absent for ENGESV
dialectCode is absent for ENGESV
dialectCode[0:3] is always equal to lang
dialectCode[3:] is always 'Latin', which is not correct
audioDirectory is absent for ENGESV
audioDirectory is always the same as bibleId
the first part of a filename is media: text or audio
