<h1>Contemporary English Version (US Version)</h1>
<p class="ip">Uncompromising simplicity marked the American Bible Society's translation of the Contemporary English Version that was first published in 1995. The text is easily read by grade schoolers, second language readers, and those who prefer the more contemporized form. The CEV is not a paraphrase; it is an accurate and faithful translation of the original manuscripts.</p>
<p class="ip">After almost 200 years of ongoing ministry, American Bible Society invites people to experience the life-changing message of the Bible. Offering an increasing range of innovative ministries to address core life questions and struggles, the Bible Society partners with Christian churches and national Bible societies to share Godâ€™s Word both in the United States and around the globe.</p>
