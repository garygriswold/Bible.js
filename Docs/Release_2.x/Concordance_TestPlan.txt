Concordance TestPlan

May 4, 2019

In ConcordanceModel.shared.search, change the call of search3() to searchTest().
This executes search1 and searchTest and compares count of results.  It does not
compare the identity of the results, but it could be improved to do that.

To test search2 and search3, devise a specific search that performs a modest search.

1. Change search3() to search1() and execute the specific test.
2. Review the results and identify the subset that should appear in a search2 or search3 test.
3. Perform a search2 and search3 test, and verify with expectations.

The following is one such test:

words: "Abide in me"

Search1				search2 		search3

1 Sam 22:23			--				once

Jer 42:10			--				--

John 12:46			twice			twice

John 15:6			--				once

John 15:7			once			once

Acts 20:23			--				--
