					<li>I believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is both fully human and fully God, and has lived a sinless life.</li>
					<li>I believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross as a substitute for the punishment that is due all people, because of their sin.  By doing this, he has given everyone their only opportunity of eternal salvation by putting their trust in Him.</li>
					<li>I believe that the Holy Spirit dwells within each person who has put their trust in Jesus Christ, and is there to teach, and help believers lead a life that is glorifying to God.</li>
					<li>I believe that all, who have put their trust in Jesus Christ, without regard to religious denomination, are part of the Church.</li>
					<li>I believe in the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ three days after His death on the cross, and that all those who have placed their trust in Him will also be resurrected to eternal life with Him, and those who have not will be resurrected to judgment.</li>
